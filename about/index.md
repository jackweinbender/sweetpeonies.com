About Me
========

Hello, my name is Tiffany and I’m so glad you stopped by our site,
*SweetPeonies* (formerly, *The Kitchen Curtains*). I am a West Coast
girl, temporarily transplanted in the South.

The hubby’s education has taken us from Oregon to Tennessee to Texas.
With all that moving, we often find ourselves missing home. But on those
days when we feel low, we remind each other that “home is wherever I’m
with you.”

This blog is a way of pushing ourselves to explore new places, build
traditions and turn each new location into home.

Thanks for stopping by. Be sure to check out the blog and give us some
feedback.

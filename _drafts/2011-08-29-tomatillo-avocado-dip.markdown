If you haven’t figured it out yet, there is no method to my kitchen madness. I sort through buckets of recipes and after “getting the gist” of the ingredients needed, I just go at it. Sometimes I substitute ingredients because I’m curious, and other times simply because I don’t have an ingredient. Really, it is only through great pains and a lot of luck that I am able to produce something resembling a recipe for you each week.

Why am I telling you this?

I made this dip. It was fantastic.

However, I didn’t measure all the ingredients.

The recipe I’ve written below should be very close to the original, but be sure to taste as you go and adjust if needed.

I know many of you have never used tomatillos before, but trust me they are worth the gamble. Tomatillos are delicious when mixed with the right ingredients. They are responsible for the tart flavor in many Mexican green sauces. I encourage you to give them a try and add a new ingredient to your family meals.

**Tomatillo Avocado Dip**

_Ingredients:_

2 tomatillos  
1 avocado  
1 tbsp half and half  
1 tbsp lemon  
2 tsp garlic  
1 tsp pepper  
1/2 tsp salt

_Instructions:_

Remove skin and pit of avocado. Chop tomatillos into smaller chunks. Combine all ingredients in a blender or food processor. Use the half and half to smooth out the dip.

Serve with your favorite chip or a plateful of fresh veggies and enjoy!

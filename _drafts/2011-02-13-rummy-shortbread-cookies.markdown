I made these cookies for our New Year’s Eve get together this year and they were a hit. The cookie is a simple shortbread recipe that takes about 10 minutes to throw together and the frosting was a combination of ideas from Linda ([Aunt Willies Wildflowers](http://www.auntwillieswildflowers.com/)) and the Pioneer Woman. You can see her original hard sauce recipe [here](http://http//thepioneerwoman.com/cooking/2010/11/hard-sauce/).

I also made these more recently for a catering event and added [chocolate shavings](http://thekitchencurtain.blogspot.com/2011/05/my-first-catering-gig.html) to the top, making the shortbread look much more elegant.

**Cookie Ingredients:**  
2 c. butter  
4 c. flour  
1 c. white sugar  
2-3 tsp. vanilla extract (I always put more vanilla)

**Cookie Prep:**

Heat oven to 350 degrees. Soften the butter. Cream butter and sugar until fluffy. Add vanilla. Add flour. Mix well. Place dough balls onto a non-stick sheet. Bake for 10 minutes. Some recipes have you cook these longer but they tend to harden once you pull them out of the oven so I like to pull mine out early so they are still somewhat soft.

The frosting combines Linda’s powdered sugar frosting and the Pioneer Woman’s idea to add liquor to the mix, she uses whiskey, I went for rum.

**Frosting Ingredients:**

1 stick of butter  
1-1.5 c. powdered sugar  
2-3 tbsp rum

**Frosting Prep:**

Barely soften the butter and mix it around in the bowl. Add in the powdered sugar. I don’t normally measure this out. When Linda makes her frosting she uses more of a pour and stir, pour and stir effort until you get the consistency you want to frost with. Once that is all mixed together, add in the rum. This is really to taste so you might as well start out slow and taste as you go until you are satisfied.

Before you frost the cookies make sure they are cool. If the cookies are not completely cool you will have runny rum sauce all over the place.

Once cool, frost the cookies. My last addition to these cookies was to add a dusting of cocoa powder, really yummy addition. You could also try coffee grounds, brown sugar, chocolate shavings, the possibilities are endless.

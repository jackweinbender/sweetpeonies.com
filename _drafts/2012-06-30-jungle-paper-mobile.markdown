Recently I’ve been working on a few decorations for a friend’s baby shower in July. Their nursery is going to have jungle decor so we decided to extend the theme to the shower as well.

[![paper jungle mobile baby shower](jekyll_uploads/2012/06/paperjunglemobile-575x365.jpg "paperjunglemobile")](http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/06/jungle-paper-mobile/paperjunglemobile/)

I found a beautiful animal print fabric for a table runner ($5/yd) and decided to contrast the muted browns with bright jungle colors.

Here are a few simple steps to making your own mobile:

1.) Cut cardstock into 1X8-inch strips. I used seven shades of brown, green, yellow and gray.

2.) Next, line the colors up in gradient order and decide on your mobile length. I ended up using 28 strips of paper for each mobile.

3.) After deciding pattern and length, stack the strips in order and head to your sewing machine. Place a piece of tape on the machine as a guide to help you sew straight down the middle of each strip of paper.

4.) Sew. Simply push each piece of paper under the needle, continue stitching until you have achieved the desired distance between strips and then place the next strip under the needle. Be sure to leave excess string on each end of your mobile for hanging.

5.) If you are using a light-weight paper, such as vellum you may want to weigh down the end of your string after hanging to avoid curling at the bottom of the mobile. [Project Wedding](http://www.projectwedding.com/wedding-ideas/diy-modern-colorful-mobiles) makes this mobile with vellum and attaches a fishing weight at the bottom to weigh it down. The card stock however, is heavy enough that this curling does not occur (hence my choosing cardstock). The cardstock is also a cheaper purchase than vellum.

_Project wedding vellum mobile:_ $25  
_Sweet Peonies cardstock mobile:_ $10 (even less if you already have various pieces of cardstock on hand like me)

I love how the mobiles turned out. I have made 5 so far and will hang them above the food table at the baby shower. I am also tying in the jungle greens by placing tall ornamental grasses on the table and surrounding areas which should complement the green mobiles nicely. I hope you’ve enjoyed this little sneak peek at the jungle baby shower. <del datetime="2012-08-11T19:36:16+00:00">I’ll be sure to post pictures of the finished event.</del> You can see finished photos of the baby shower [here](http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/08/jungle-safari-baby-shower/).

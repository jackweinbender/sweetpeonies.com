These banana bars were absolutely delightful. I added a hint of rum to the batter and topped them off with rum frosting. Best of all, they are actually not too terrible of a calorie killer, sitting at about 130 calories per bar.

**Banana Bar Ingredients:**

3 tbsp. butter  
1-1/2 c. sugar  
2 eggs  
1/4 c. applesauce  
2 or 3 mashed ripe bananas  
2 tsp. rum  
1 tsp. vanilla  
2 c. flour  
1 tsp. baking soda  
pinch of salt

**Frosting Ingredient:**

1 stick of butter (1/2 c.)  
1-1.5 c. powdered sugar  
2-3 tbsp. rum

**Instructions:**

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Cream butter and sugar on low with an electric mixer. Add eggs one at a time. Mix in mashed ripe bananas (3 will make them more moist). Add remaining ingredients and blend well.

Pour batter into a large dish. These bars rise quite a bit. I used a 9Ã—13\. Bake for 20-25 minutes or until an inserted toothpick comes out clean.

For the frosting, barely soften the butter and blend with powdered sugar until the sugar binds to the butter. Add rum. If the consistency looks too runny, simply add more powdered sugar until the mixture is spreadable.

Once the bars are baked, let them cool completely before cutting and frosting.

Happy baking!

There are two dishes that I tend to crave without warning, macaroni and cheese and sloppy joes. Luckily, both of these dishes can be quickly thrown together, even with the measly ingredients found in the dark barren wasteland I commonly refer to as my fridge.

Last week, following a particularly hot and muggy day on the farm, I haphazardly threw these ingredients together in the hopes of creating something spectacular. Both Jack and I were VERY happy with the finished result, especially considering how quickly this pulls together. It is oh so tasty! If you don’t have all of these ingredients, feel free to substitute (I always do). As long as there is ketchup and Worcestershire, I don’t think you can fail.

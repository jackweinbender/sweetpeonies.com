[![chicken feeder lettuce](jekyll_uploads/2011/02/chickenfeederlettuce-325x456.jpg "chickenfeederlettuce")](http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/02/chicken-feeder-centerpiece/chickenfeederlettuce/)Many of the projects you will find here on Sweet Peonies come from the Doan farm or are at the very least inspired by the farm.

The Doans run a specialty cut-flower farm called _Aunt Willie’s Wildflowers_. Linda spends most of the spring and summer growing cut flowers for farmer’s markets. She also teaches various flower arranging workshops and arranges flowers for weddings. Her workshops feature a variety of creative arrangements–from teapots to stumps, you name it, she can arrange in it. Check out Linda’s website [Aunt Willie’s Wildflowers](http://auntwillieswildflowers.com/).

Linda used this centerpiece for one of the workshops last spring and I, of course, fell in love with the idea. All she did was take an old chicken feeder, fill it with soil & plant multiple lettuce varieties. The centerpiece at the workshop lunch was this feeder and the ladies were able to pick leaves of lettuce to add to their salads.

For any of you looking to bring a bit of country to your next get together, I highly recommend giving this a try.

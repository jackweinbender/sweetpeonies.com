Sorry for the brief hiatus from posting, I hope you all have had a chance to check out last week’s [Jungle Safari Baby Shower](http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/08/jungle-safari-baby-shower/). The hubby and I decided to take a last-minute trip up to Baltimore this weekend to visit our good friends Adam and Leslie. We kind of love them. With classes starting back in one week, we figured it was one of those “now-or-never” moments.

We had such a blast in Baltimore. Breakfast at Gertrudes outside the BMA, seriously the most amazing basil hollandaise sauce over eggplant and poached eggs. It was _so_ delicious that I decided my latest mission is to cook the perfect poached egg.

Anyways, back to our weekend. We took in the beautiful views on Federal Hill overlooking the harbor.

Took a walk around Fort McHenry (think Star Spangled Banner). Loved the ocean views surrounding the fort.

We even managed a mini beach trip on Sunday followed by dinner in Little Italy and the most amazing cannolis. Yes, it was a great weekend.

Tomorrow is another day of flower cutting and market arranging at the farm. Kristin and I will be running the flower business at the Kingsport Farmer’s Market on Saturday so anyone in the area should come out and visit us. I promise, once you see the flowers you won’t regret giving up your Saturday morning. I’ll be sure to take some fun market pictures for you all. Happy Weekend!

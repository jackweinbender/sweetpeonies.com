Lately in our little corner of the world, we’ve been catching tiny glimpses of spring. While parts of our country are still trudging through a constant flurry of snowflakes and torrents of rain, here in Tennessee we are seeing longer, brighter days as the sunshine makes an early debut. All I can say is it has been glorious!

The other day, I received my West Elm catalog in the mail. If you haven’t discovered [West Elm](http://www.westelm.com/) you should head over to their website for a peak at hundreds of lovely home decorating ideas. When I opened the front page, I was met with this image of bright, cheery, sunshiney goodness.

It made my day and only affirmed what I’ve known in my heart these past few days, spring really _is_ coming!

In the few moments of spare time I’ve had lately, I’ve been working on a trial doll project for my niece’s birthday. I recently finished my doll’s body and thought I would share the results. I have seen many doll patterns floating around the internet but they all seemed too complicated to attempt until I found this [Black Apple Doll pattern on Martha Stewart’s website](http://www.marthastewart.com/264299/black-apple-doll?lnc=38f9cf380e1dd010VgnVCM1000005b09a00aRCRD&rsc=showmain_tv_the-martha-stewart-show).

The pattern is from Emily Martin who is well-known from her Etsy shop, [The Black Apple](http://www.etsy.com/shop/theblackapple) (be sure to check out her [blog](http://www.theblackapple.typepad.com/) too). I am also working on a few clothing items to fit the doll–a hat, scarf, dress, apron, etc. As you can see, Ms. Dolly has no face yet, I can’t seem to decide what type of face she should have but will be sure to post pictures when I do.

I am also working on backdrops to fit into a suitcase so Ms. Dolly has a home of her own. Check out these wonderfully creative [doll suitcases at Hart & Sew](http://hartandsew.blogspot.com/2011/01/doll-suitcase.html).

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Sarah! We had been working on basic menus for some time now but it wasn&#039;t until I literally started writing out each day of the month that this idea really took off. So far, it has worked out great especially with our crazy schedules. Unfortunately, it seems there are often just not enough hours in the day. Glad you enjoyed the post. Thanks for reading!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great ideas Tiff. This is something John and I started doing a couple years ago. Although we grocery shop 2x a month. Having a planned out menu helps in soo many areas... not just the budget but health. If you have planned and purchases what you are having for dinner... you are less likely to say &quot;let&#039;s go out&quot; and you dont play the &quot;what do we WANT for dinner tonight&quot; game. Since the item has already been defrosted when i get home from work I make it. If not it messes up the plan lol and i refuse to waste food. Such great practical tips!

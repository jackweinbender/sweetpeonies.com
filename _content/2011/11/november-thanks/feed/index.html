		<description><![CDATA[THANKFUL... such a big thought; one we don&#039;t (me) think about often enough!  I have the most precious gifts; all of which I am not entitled to have.  Incredible children beyond my wildest hopes and dreams,  an amazing extended family whom I loved from the moment God whispered that our encounters were for a reason (pay attention), an adopted family (who showed me what love, unconditional love, is and without them my life, I am certain, would have looked different than it does today). A marriage of 31 years &quot;wow and rare&quot;! . . . and much more, but. . .

I think perhaps those are the things that come to mind first and yet, those are not the only things that enter my mind. I am also thankful for all the trials, hard work, times when life just isn&#039;t fair, yes even sadness.  Why? Because it is those moments that I have known, many times and very personally, that cause me to cherish the moments that are surrounded by all the people and times mentioned in the first paragraph!

I am thankful, although not always happy, but thankful for all of life and GRATEFUL TO GOD!

Tiffany, you are an amazing young women, with amazing gifts...I am thankful for YOU!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes! I am planning to add mom&#039;s recipe to the site sometime this month. Probably after I make it for Turkey day.

And no, I didn&#039;t forget to mention the part about my birthday. I had it in there originally but was going to do another post on birthdays this month.]]></description>

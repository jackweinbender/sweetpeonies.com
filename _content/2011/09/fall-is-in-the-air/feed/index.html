		<description><![CDATA[These flowers are so pretty!  I think I might like them better than real ones on my table for the following reasons: they will never get smelly, I won&#039;t have to watch them droop and get ugly and there is no need to throw them away.  

I can just come on this page and look at the beautiful arrangements, get a happy feeling, (proud too knowing you put them together) and then I can go about my day.  :)

Oh, and I LOVE sweaters too and I can&#039;t wait for the weather to get a bit cooler so I can start wearing them.  Ooops, most of mine are too big now; guess it&#039;s time to go buy a few.  ]]></description>

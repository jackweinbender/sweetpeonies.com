		<description><![CDATA[Hey, welcome to the Daring Bakers! I&#039;m new too, I started last month. It&#039;s a great commnity, I&#039;m so glad to be involved. 

I love the idea of apple croissants, perhaps if I&#039;d made the effort to do filled croissants I&#039;d have been more in love with them - certainly looking at everyone else&#039;s makes me think I&#039;m missing out! ]]></description>

		<p><em>Hello Friends! Jack and I are working hard to wrap up this last semester of school which, unfortunately, means very little time to share fun projects with you. Luckily, I have a wonderfully talented and creative friend (Kira) who was willing to help me out with posting. Kira and her husband are both incredibly talented photographers based in Oregon. Head over to her <a href="http://www.kiraandmatt.com">website </a>for a peek at her work. Today Kira is sharing a super easy and fun lace sweatshirt DIY. Enjoy!</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2013/02/diy-lace-sleeve-sweatshirt/libraryandlace-3153/" rel="attachment wp-att-5330"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2013/02/libraryandlace-3153-575x862.png" alt="libraryandlace-3153" width="575" height="862" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-5330" /></a></p>
<p>So excited to share this super easy DIY with all you lovely Sweet Peonies readers!</p>
<p>Every winter, just before spring, I always seems to pick up Pride and Prejudice and read it through in a week. I don&#8217;t really re-read books, except for this one. It&#8217;s lovely. And comforting. And it inspired me to add a little more lace to my wardrobe and tea to my afternoons.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2013/02/diy-lace-sleeve-sweatshirt/libraryandlace-1/" rel="attachment wp-att-5328"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2013/02/libraryandlace-1-575x431.png" alt="libraryandlace-1" width="575" height="431" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-5328" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/77053843596992620/">Inspired by this little pin on Pinterest</a>, I scored this $3 sweatshirt  (at Walmart) and some lace and went to work. I really LOVE how it turned out. Super simple and pretty much no sewing skills required (I literally followed the directions in the Pinterest caption). And very cozy. Perfect for reading.</p>
<p>One of my favorite spots to read is the local Public Library. It is so peaceful and has so many gorgeous windows that the place is always flooded with light, even when it&#8217;s dark and rainy like today.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2013/02/diy-lace-sleeve-sweatshirt/libraryandlace-3155/" rel="attachment wp-att-5331"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2013/02/libraryandlace-3155-575x383.png" alt="libraryandlace-3155" width="575" height="383" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-5331" /></a></p>
<p>Do you ever find yourself coming back to a certain book? Do tell!</p>
<p>{Thanks to my husband Matt for taking these photos during his study break. Straight up gentleman that one.}</p>

<p><strong>D</strong>etails, details, details! I have noticed that in the past few years the detail elements of a wedding day have become increasingly important to brides, wedding planners and photographers. If you look at any wedding style blogs, like <a href="http://www.stylemepretty.com/">Style Me Pretty</a>, <a href="http://www.oncewed.com/">Once Wed</a>, <a href="http://greenweddingshoes.com/">Green Wedding Shoes</a> and countless others, the photography featured revolves around how to implement fantastic detail and intricacy into a wedding or event.</p>
<p><strong>A</strong>s a wedding photographer I realized that I needed to learn quickly how to take the kind of photos that would highlight and pay tribute to the details every bride, florist and wedding coordinator spend countless hours creating.<br />
Of course at the end of the day, the photo of the “first kiss” is more important to my client than the cool photograph of the cupcake tower or bouquets. However, details seam together the story of the day, revealing something about the bride and groom, and hopefully reminding them of the depth of their wedding day.</p>
<p><strong>A</strong>lthough I have certainly not mastered how to take detail shots, I have learned a lot in the past few years and thought I would share some specifics of what I’ve learned here with you. Even if you’re not a photographer these techniques can apply to any detail photo you may want to take. From taking photos of your latest creation in the kitchen, to the flowers blooming in your garden to the next event you attend or host.</p>
<p>1) <strong>Find good light</strong>- The first thing to do is make sure you have great natural light. Seriously, light can make the difference between a mediocre photograph and a photo that makes you sigh! Sometimes this will mean moving the object of your photograph from its original location (if possible) to a location with better light. The photo below is from a wedding I recently shot. I was taking photos of the reception details and took this photo of the tiered cookie stand. The first one was taken in the afternoon (before anyone came into the reception) and I didn’t have time to move it to better light. It is dark and although it works, it is not the best photo. Later in the evening the room was filled with lovely light and I got this photograph of the same detail.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/02/guest-post-photographing-details/detailsblog1/" rel="attachment wp-att-3433"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/02/detailsblog1-575x427.jpg" alt="" title="detailsblog1" width="575" height="427" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3433" /></a></p>
<p>2) <strong>Remove anything distracting</strong>- I learned this tip from <a href="http://www.jasminestarblog.com/">Jasmine Star</a> in her first <a href="http://www.creativelive.com/courses/jasmine_star">creative live workshop</a>. She encouraged photographers to move anything that would “cheapen” the photo. Feel free to move things like salt and pepper, serving utensils and sugar packets from a table. And of course, put them back after you get the photo you need. Before I heard Jasmine talk about this, I was too afraid to touch or move anything on the wedding day. I didn’t want to mess anything up. However, once I had the confidence to remove distracting items from my frame, my photos of flowers and tables settings started looking more like something you could find in a magazine. Holla!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/02/guest-post-photographing-details/detailsblog2/" rel="attachment wp-att-3434"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/02/detailsblog2-575x383.jpg" alt="" title="detailsblog2" width="575" height="383" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3434" /></a></p>
<p>3) <strong>Use surrounding environment</strong>- Use your environment to add interest to your photograph. First take a few photos of your object and then take a step back. What else in the room can you use to your advantage? Is there a window that can act as a natural frame for your object? Are there other elements already in the room that you can add to your photograph to make it tell a story? An example of this is in the photos below. I took these photos this summer at <a href="http://www.kiranoblephotographyblog.com/2011/08/the-vue-wedding-jack-shay/">Jackson and Shayla’s wedding</a>. Shayla got ready at her parents beautiful home. I started out the day taking photos of her jewelry, shoes, dress and makeup. I wanted close-up photos of her hair-piece and rings and I started out in a spot I thought had good light, but the background was a little boring. Then I saw the antique books sitting on the coffee table. I moved the rings and hair-piece and immediately the photos took on more life. The books, wood tray and burlap added texture the photograph was missing.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/02/guest-post-photographing-details/detailsblog3/" rel="attachment wp-att-3435"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/02/detailsblog3-575x425.jpg" alt="" title="detailsblog3" width="575" height="425" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3435" /></a></p>
<p>4)<strong> Lower your perspective-</strong>- This one is simple. To diversify your the kind of detail shots you take, simply change up your angle and perspective. At first, I simply shot a table setting by standing above it and shooting down. While this type of perspective can yield good photos, changing your angle or getting “low” can capture the setting and mood in a much stronger way. The photos below are from <a href="http://www.kiranoblephotographyblog.com/2011/09/oregon-city-golf-club-wedding/">Dani and Tyson’s</a>wedding last summer. One was shot from above, the other I shot by getting on my knees and getting “eye level” with the table.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/02/guest-post-photographing-details/detailsblog4/" rel="attachment wp-att-3436"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/02/detailsblog4-575x459.jpg" alt="" title="detailsblog4" width="575" height="459" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3436" /></a></p>
<p>5) <strong>Shoot wide-open</strong>- In my opinion, one of the best ways to get strong detail shots is to shoot with your camera set at a low f-stop. (Click <a href="http://www.homephotog.com/tutorials/aperture.shtml">HERE</a>to read a great explanation about aperture and f-stops.) By shooting “wide-open” you not only get the most out of all the pretty light, your detail will stand out and you’ll achieve that cool “drop-off” effect. Below are a few detail photos that I shot wide open and the settings.</p>
<p>85mm 1.8 1/30 and ISO 250</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/02/guest-post-photographing-details/detailsblog5/" rel="attachment wp-att-3437"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/02/detailsblog5-575x383.jpg" alt="" title="detailsblog5" width="575" height="383" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3437" /></a></p>
<p>50mm 1.8 1/320 ISO 400</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/02/guest-post-photographing-details/detailasblog6/" rel="attachment wp-att-3432"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/02/detailasblog6-575x383.jpg" alt="" title="detailasblog6" width="575" height="383" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3432" /></a></p>
<p>Grab your camera and start shooting!</p>

		<p><em>I have one more test before Fall break so I apologize, once again, for the &#8220;few and far between&#8221; posts. However, today you are in luck&#8230; Meredith has written another guest post for you all! Today she is sharing a fabulous recipe for no-knead bread.<br />
</em><br />
My husband is the bread-baker in our family. When I met him, I&#8217;d been baking my own bread for about a year, because I&#8217;m a good baker. There&#8217;s no reason I shouldn&#8217;t be able to do bread. But I&#8217;d messed it up differently every time. Forgot the salt. Didn&#8217;t knead long enough. Under-baked. Burned. Wrong, wrong, wrong.</p>
<p>Then I met Jon, who worked at a bakery in our neighborhood. A wonderful bakery, with fabulous artisan breads, baked in an amazing multi-deck stone hearth oven. At the time, he worked mixing and benching, and eventually he started baking. He brought home more bread than we could eat. Then he started practicing at home. He never forgets the salt.</p>
<p>So I quit messing with bread. We moved to Northeast Tennessee, and our artisan bread options are limited. Jon bakes some, but he&#8217;s working full-time and going to school full-time, and time is precious. So we&#8217;ve been making do with the grocery store stuff, the sliced kind for my son&#8217;s pb &amp; j&#8217;s, and an occasional &#8220;artisan-style&#8221; loaf for my morning toast.</p>
<p>Then <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/08/dining/081mrex.html" target="_blank">Jim Lahey&#8217;s no-knead bread</a>, no stone hearth required, started drifting in and out of my attention. I vaguely remember hearing about this on NPR some years ago, and not really paying attention because I&#8217;m not the bread-baker.  But a little over a year ago, a friend served no-knead bread at a dinner party. And it was delicious. Then, for Christmas, we received Amanda Hesser&#8217;s <em>The Essential New York Times Cookbook: Classic Recipes for a New Century, </em>which reprints favorites from the past 150 years or so of <em>Times</em> food writing. And it includes this recipe. Several months later, I&#8217;ve finally gotten around to trying it. (It was the first esting time that got me. Figuring out when to start this so that 12-18 hours later I could work with it, and then have 3 more hours or so before it was finished required waaay too much math.)</p>
<p>Yesterday, after really wanting toast for breakfast and having Corn Flakes instead, I decided to try it.  While the kids ate dinner, I put together the dough.</p>
<ul>
<li>3 Cups all-purpose flour</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon instant yeast</li>
<li>1 1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>1 1/2 cups water</li>
</ul>
<div>     Mix together in a large bowl. Cover with plastic wrap, and let rest 12-18 hours.</div>
<div>This morning, the dough had risen considerably, and was speckled with bubbles about to break through. I let it go until 10:15 or so, about 16 hours after I&#8217;d mixed it up (less because of its readiness &#8211; Hesser says 18 hours is preferable, but that it&#8217;s ready when covered with little bubbles &#8211; and more because that timing worked out well for my chances of working without the kids&#8217; &#8220;help.&#8221;)</div>
<div></div>
<div>     Here the directions say to turn the dough out onto a lightly floured board, and fold over itself once or twice. I chose twice, and the dough smoothed into a neat little roundish packet. After covering it loosely with plastic wrap and letting it rest 15 minutes, I floured my hands, shaped it into a ball (sort of &#8211; it&#8217;s a really loose dough), and set it on a towel (not terrycloth) covered with cornmeal. A little more cornmeal on top, cover with another towel, and let rise 2-2 1/2 hours. When it&#8217;s ready to bake, it won&#8217;t spring back readily when pressed with fingertips.</div>
<div></div>
<div>     While it rose (just before taking my kids upstairs for naptime), I turned on the oven to preheat my pot. I&#8217;m saving my money and watching clearance racks for <a href="http://www.csnstores.com/popups/media_viewer_images.php?sku=SAB1087" target="_blank">dream pot</a>, so this time I just used my regular All Clad stainless 8 quart soup pot. A heavier pot with a tighter-fitting lid probably would&#8217;ve worked better, but this one did just fine. I heated it at 450 while I put the kids down, and by the time they were asleep the bread was ready to go. Out came the pot, in went the bread, down went the lid, and into the oven. After half an hour, I took the lid off, and left it for another 20 minutes or so to brown up.</div>
<div></div>
<div>     And I have to say, it&#8217;s decent bread. Not quite as tall as I might like, perhaps, but for the effort expended . . . it&#8217;s fantastic! And it&#8217;ll hold up admirably to butter &amp; jam in the morning. I&#8217;m a happy girl.</div>

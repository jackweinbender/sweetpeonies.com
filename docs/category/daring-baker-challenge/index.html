    <p><em>The Daring Baker’s October 2011 challenge was Povitica, hosted by Jenni of The Gingered Whisk. Povitica is a traditional Eastern European Dessert Bread that is as lovely to look at as it is to eat!</em></p>

<p>Of course, this being my first attempt, I think it was better to taste than to look at but maybe that’s just me. My first try (see image below) didn’t set up as well as it should have, I think partially because I didn’t grind the walnuts small enough, so this should look more solid than gooey. However, it still tasted great!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/10/october-daring-bakers-challenge-povitica/povitica-007-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/10/Povitica-0071-575x381.jpg" alt="" title="Walnut" /></a></p>

<p>If any of you were brave enough to try last month’s croissant challenge, I have good news for you…this is 100 times easier and takes much less time. Really.</p>

<p>I loved this challenge. Povitica dough is extremely easy to roll out, none of that rebound curling that we had with the croissant dough. And, to make it even better, I thought this entire process was fun. It is a different way of making bread that is intriguing throughout the entire process.</p>

<p>I made one loaf the normal way, with walnuts and what not, two with a pumpkin filling and one with feta, cheddar cheese, and herbs. All of them tasted great. So, although this is meant to be a dessert bread, feel free to substitute the filling with whatever warms the cockles of your heart.</p>

<p><em>A few tips:</em></p>

<p>1.) When the directions say to roll out the dough super thin, DO IT! It really isn’t difficult and it makes the inside look fantastic. You can see in my pumpkin bread especially, I didn’t roll it out as much and the filling wasn’t as thick, making the design harder to appreciate.</p>

<p>2.) Make sure you grind up the walnuts well. I simply crushed them haphazardly and the edges of the large chunks made rolling a tedious process as I attempted not to poke a hole in my dough.</p>

<p>3.) When you roll the dough, don’t try to pick it up as you go, simply push little bits at a time, separating it from your workspace by gently rolling it over the filling mixture.</p>

<p>4.) This bread really is beautiful when done right, thicker less liquidy filling works best. Wrap a 3-in. wide piece of burlap around the middle of the bread with a thinner piece of ribbon, and give away as Christmas gifts.</p>

<p><em>Recipe: Courtesy of Jenni</em><br />
<strong><em>Ingredients</em></strong></p>

<p><em>To activate the Yeast:</em><br />
2 Teaspoons (10 ml/9 gm) Sugar<br />
1 Teaspoon (5 ml/3 gm) All-Purpose (Plain) Flour<br />
½ Cup (120ml) Warm Water<br />
2 Tablespoons (30ml/14 gm/½ oz/2 sachets) Dry Yeast</p>

<p><em>Dough:</em><br />
2 Cups (480ml) Whole Milk<br />
¾ Cup (180 ml/170gm/6 oz) Sugar<br />
3 Teaspoons (15 ml/18 gm/2/3 oz) Table Salt<br />
4 Large Eggs<br />
½ Cup (120ml/115 gm/one stick/4 oz) Unsalted Butter, melted<br />
8 cups (1.92 l/1.12 kg/39½ oz/2½ lb) All-Purpose Flour, measure first then sift, divided</p>

<p><em>Walnut Filling:</em><br />
7 Cups (1.68 l/1.12 kg/2.5 lbs) Ground English Walnuts<br />
1 Cup (240ml) Whole Milk<br />
1 Cup (240ml/225 gm/2 sticks/8 oz) Unsalted Butter<br />
2 Whole Eggs, Beaten<br />
1 Teaspoon (5ml) Pure Vanilla Extract<br />
2 Cups (480ml/450 gm/16 oz) Sugar<br />
1 Teaspoon (5 ml/4 gm) Unsweetened Cocoa Powder<br />
1 Teaspoon (5 ml/3 gm) Cinnamon</p>

<p><em>Topping:</em><br />
½ Cup (120 ml) Cold STRONG Coffee<br />
2 Tablespoons (30 ml/28 gm/1 oz) Granulated Sugar<br />
Melted Butter</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/10/october-daring-bakers-challenge-povitica/povitica-029-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/10/Povitica-0291-325x215.jpg" alt="" title="Povitica 029" /></a></p>

<p><strong><em>Directions:</em></strong></p>

<p><em>To Activate Yeast:</em></p>

<p>In a small bowl, stir 2 teaspoons sugar, 1 teaspoon flour, and the yeast into ½ cup warm water and cover with plastic wrap. Allow to stand for 5 minutes</p>

<p><em>To Make the Dough:</em></p>

<p>1. In a medium saucepan, heat the milk up to just below boiling (about 180°F/82°C), stirring constantly so that a film does not form on the top of the milk. You want it hot enough to scald you, but not boiling. Allow to cool slightly, until it is about 110°F/43°C.<br />
2. In a large bowl, mix the scalded milk, ¾ cup (180 gm/170 gm/6 oz) sugar, and the salt until combined.<br />
3. Add the beaten eggs, yeast mixture, melted butter, and 2 cups (480 ml/280 gm/10 oz) of flour.<br />
4. Blend thoroughly and slowly add remaining flour, mixing well until the dough starts to clean the bowl.<br />
5. Turn dough out onto floured surface and knead, gradually adding flour a little at a time, until smooth and does not stick. Note: You may not use all 8 c. of flour<br />
6. Divide the dough into 4 equal pieces (they will each weight about 1.25 pounds/565 grams)<br />
7. Place dough in 4 lightly oiled bowls, cover loosely with a layer of plastic wrap and then a kitchen towel and let rise an hour and a half in a warm place, until doubled in size.</p>

<p><em>To Make the Filling:</em></p>

<p>1. In a large bowl mix together the ground walnuts, sugar, cinnamon and cocoa.<br />
2. Heat the milk and butter to boiling. Pour the liquid over the nut/sugar mixture.<br />
3. Add the eggs and vanilla and mix thoroughly. Allow to stand at room temperature until ready to be spread on the dough. If the mixture thickens, add a small amount of warm milk.</p>

<p><em>To Roll and Assemble the Dough:</em></p>

<p>1. Spread a clean sheet or cloth over your entire table so that it is covered. (I didn’t use a sheet or cloth) Sprinkle with a couple of tablespoons to a handful of flour (use flour sparingly).<br />
2. Place the dough on the sheet and roll the dough out with a rolling pin, starting in the middle and working your way out, until it measures roughly 10-12 inches (25½ cm by 30½ cm) in diameter<br />
3. Spoon 1 to 1.5 teaspoons (5ml to 7 ½ ml/4 gm to 7 gm) of melted butter on top.<br />
4. Using the tops of your hands, stretch dough out from the center until the dough is thin and uniformly opaque. You can also use your rolling pin, if you prefer.</p>

<p><em>Tip:</em> As you work, continually pick up the dough from the table, not only to help in stretching it out, but also to make sure that it isn’t sticking.</p>

<p>5. When you think the dough is thin enough, try to get it a little thinner. It should be so thin that you can see the color and perhaps the pattern of the sheet or counter underneath.<br />
6. Spoon filling evenly over dough until covered. Lift the edge of the cloth and gently roll the dough like a jelly roll.<br />
7. Once the dough is rolled up into a rope, gently lift it up and place it into a greased loaf pan in the shape of a “U”, with the ends meeting in the middle. You want to coil the dough around itself, as this will give the dough its characteristic look when sliced.<br />
8. Repeat with remaining three loaves, coiling each rope of dough in its own loaf pan.</p>

<p><em>Finishing Touches:</em></p>

<p>1. Brush the top of each loaf with a mixture of ½ cup (120 ml) of cold STRONG coffee and 2 tablespoons (30ml/28 gm/1 oz) of sugar. If you prefer, you can also use egg whites in place of this. Cover pans lightly will plastic wrap and allow to rest for approximately 15 minutes.<br />
2. Preheat oven to moderate 350°F/180°C/gas mark 4.<br />
3. Remove plastic wrap from dough and place into the preheated oven and bake for approximately 15 minutes.<br />
4. Turn down the oven temperature to slow 300°F/150°C/gas mark 2 and bake for an additional 45 minutes, or until done.<br />
5. Remove bread from oven and brush with melted butter.<br />
6. Check the bread at 30 minutes to ensure that the bread is not getting too brown. You may cover the loaves with a sheet of aluminum foil if you need to.<br />
7. Remove from the oven and allow to cool on a wire rack for 20-30 minutes, still in the bread pan. Remember, the bread weighs about 2.5 and it needs to be able to hold its own weight, which is difficult when still warm and fresh out of the oven. Allowing it to cool in the pan helps the loaf to hold its shape.</p>

<p><em>Tip:</em> It is recommended that the best way to cut Povitica loaves into slices is by turning the loaf upside down and slicing with a serrated knife.</p>

    <p>I had the privilege of participating in my first ever “Daring Baker” challenge. What is Daring Baker? Daring Baker comes from <a href="http://thedaringkitchen.com">The Daring Kitchen</a> a website that challenges both bloggers and non-bloggers to a different baking or cooking challenge each month. The bloggers attempt a difficult recipe, then blog about it on the same day each month, revealing to their readers what the secret challenge was. I joined in August and was ready for my first challenge this month, and what a time to start!</p>

<p>The Daring Bakers go retro this month! Thanks to one of our very talented non-blogging members, Sarah, the Daring Bakers were challenged to make Croissants using a recipe from the Queen of French Cooking, none other than Julia Child!</p>

<p>Lucky for me, croissants are a baking challenge I’d been dying to try ever since watching “It’s Complicated”-with their bakery scene making pain au chocolat (chocolate croissants).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/09/september-daring-baker-challenge/chili-croissants-115/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/09/chili-croissants-115-575x320.jpg" alt="" title="Apple Croissants" /></a></p>

<p>Now, I don’t know how many of you realize how truly involved the process of baking croissants can be (I didn’t). Perhaps you have a never-fail family recipe that you can whip up and serve hot, fluffy croissants in a jiff…</p>

<p>This is not one of those recipes.</p>

<p>My dough sat overnight twice, if that gives you an idea of the time investment. It is possible to make these in one day, if you have one FULL day to spend on croissant making (it takes 12 hours). I, however, did not. So there, you are warned.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/09/september-daring-baker-challenge/chili-croissants-130/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/09/chili-croissants-130-325x215.jpg" alt="" title="chili, croissants 130" /></a></p>

<p>I was surprisingly happy with how my croissants turned out, that is until I went to our secret forum to see the other blogger’s results. Some of them were out of this world fantastic. I’m jealous.</p>

<p>However, to be a good sport (and show you that croissants can be well-worth the effort), I am posting links to some of the croissant-bakers blogs that seemed to really outdo themselves. Be sure to visit and show them some love.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/09/september-daring-baker-challenge/chili-croissants-020/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/09/chili-croissants-020-325x215.jpg" alt="" title="Envelope Fold" /></a></p>

<p>I think I’ve decided my issue was the second dough rise. I’m not exactly sure what went wrong (I followed the instructions to a T), perhaps the Tennessee humidity was my downfall. Hmmm…</p>

<p>I also wanted them to be a bit darker than the result. I did a double egg wash, coating the dough in a generous amount of egg/milk mix, and then again right before placing into the oven. Others did the same process with a much different result.</p>

<p>I read a few tips that may help those who prefer a dark shell:</p>

<p>1. use a pan that has low edges/rim so it doesn’t block heat from gliding across the croissants<br />
2. space out your croissants placing only 6 on a pan (I put all 12 on one pan) in order to allow more circulation of heat</p>

<p><a href="http://audaxartifex.blogspot.com/">Audax Artifex</a> has some great tips to getting beautiful croissants.</p>

<p>I ended up making a few plain croissants, pain au cholocat, and apples and cinnamon.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/09/september-daring-baker-challenge/chili-croissants-090/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/09/chili-croissants-090-325x215.jpg" alt="" title="chili, croissants 090" /></a></p>

<p>And without further ado, for the brave at heart, Julia Child’s Recipe (Mastering the Art of French Cooking, Vol. 2). I have grouped the steps into manageable segments.</p>

<p><em>Ingredients</em></p>

<p>¼ oz (7 gm) of fresh yeast, or 1¼ teaspoon (6¼ ml/4 gm) of dry-active yeast (about ½ sachet)<br />
3 tablespoons (45 ml) warm water (less than 100°F/38°C)<br />
1 teaspoon (5 ml/4½ gm) sugar<br />
1 3/4 cups (225 gm/½ lb) of strong plain flour (I used Polish all-purpose flour, which is 13% protein)<br />
2 teaspoons (10 ml/9 gm) sugar<br />
1½ teaspoon (7½ ml/9 gm) salt<br />
½ cup (120 ml/¼ pint) milk (I am not sure if the fat content matters. I used 2%)<br />
2 tablespoons (30 ml) tasteless oil (I used generic vegetable oil)<br />
½ cup (120 ml/1 stick/115 gm/¼ lb) chilled, unsalted butter<br />
1 egg, for egg wash</p>

<p><em>Directions:</em></p>

<p>1. Mix the yeast, warm water, and first teaspoon of sugar in a small bowl. Allow the yeast and sugar to dissolve and the yeast to foam slightly.<br />
2. Measure out the other ingredients and heat the milk until tepid, dissolve in the salt and remaining sugar.<br />
3. Scoop flour into a large bowl. Add oil, yeast mixture, and milk. Mix with a rubber spatula, don’t over mix.<br />
4. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface, and let it rest while you wash out the bowl.<br />
5. Knead the dough eight to ten times. Check out this video from Julia Child.<br />
6. Place the dough back in the bowl, and place the entire bowl in a plastic bag.<br />
7. Leave the bowl at approximately 75°F/24°C for three hours, or until the dough has tripled in size.</p>

<p>8. After the dough has tripled in size, remove it gently from the bowl, pulling it away from the sides of the bowl with your fingertips.<br />
9. Place the dough on a lightly floured board or countertop, and use your hands to press it out into a rectangle, about 8 X 12 inches (20cm X 30cm).<br />
10. Fold the dough rectangle in three, like a letter (fold the top third down, and then the bottom third up).<br />
11. Place the dough letter back in the bowl, and the bowl back in the plastic bag. Leave the dough to rise for another 1.5 hours, or until it has doubled in size. This second rise can be done overnight in the fridge.</p>

<p>12. Place the double-risen dough onto a plate and cover tightly with plastic wrap. Place the plate in the fridge while you prepare the butter.<br />
13. Once the dough has doubled, it’s time to incorporate the butter. Place the block of chilled butter on a chopping board.<br />
14. Using the rolling pin, beat the butter down a little, till it is quite flat. Use the heel of your hand to continue to spread the butter until it is smooth. You want the butter to stay cool, but spread easily.<br />
15.Remove the dough from the fridge and place it on a lightly floured board or counter. Let it rest for a minute or two.<br />
16. Spread the dough using your hands into a rectangle about 14 X 8 inches (35 cm bX 20 cm).<br />
17. Remove the butter from the board, and place it on the top half of the dough rectangle.<br />
18. Spread the butter all across the top two-thirds of the dough rectangle, but keep it ¼ inch (6 mm) across from all the edges.<br />
19.. Fold the top third of the dough down, and the bottom third of the dough up. Turn the dough package 90 degrees, so that the top flap is to your right (like a book).<br />
20. Roll out the dough package (gently, so you don’t push the butter out of the dough) until it is again about 14 X 8 inches (35 cm bX 20 cm). Again, fold the top third down and the bottom third up.<br />
21. Wrap the dough package in plastic wrap, and place it in the fridge for 2 hours.</p>

<p>22. After two hours have passed, take the dough out of the fridge and place it again on the lightly floured board or counter.<br />
23. Tap the dough with the rolling pin, to deflate it a little. Let the dough rest for 8 to 10 minutes.<br />
24. Roll the dough package out till it is 14 X 8 inches (35 cm X 20 cm). Fold in three, as before.<br />
25. Turn 90 degrees, and roll out again to 14 X 8 inches (35 cm X 20 cm). Fold in three for the last time, wrap in plastic, and return the dough package to the fridge for two more hours (or overnight, with something heavy on top to stop it from rising).</p>

<p>26. It’s now time to cut the dough and shape the croissants.First, lightly butter your baking sheet.<br />
27. Take the dough out of the fridge and let it rest for ten minutes on the lightly floured board or counter. Roll the dough out into a 20 X 5 inch rectangle (51 cm X 12½ cm).<br />
28. Cut the dough into two rectangles (each 10 X 5 inches (25½ cm X 12½ cm). Place one of the rectangles in the fridge, to keep the butter cold.<br />
29. Roll the second rectangle out until it is 15 X 5 inches (38 cm X 12½ cm).<br />
30. Cut the rectangle into three squares (each 5 X 5 inches (12½ cm X 12½ cm). Place two of the squares in the fridge<br />
31. The remaining square may have shrunk up a little bit in the meantime. Roll it out again till it is nearly square. Cut the square diagonally into two triangles.<br />
32. Stretch the triangle out a little, so it is not a right-angle triangle, but more of an isosceles.<br />
33. Starting at the wide end, roll the triangle up towards the point, and curve into a crescent shape.<br />
34. Place the unbaked croissant on the baking sheet<br />
35. Repeat the process with the remaining squares of dough, creating 12 croissants in total.<br />
36. Leave the tray of croissants, covered lightly with plastic wrap, to rise for 1 hour.</p>

<p>37. Preheat the oven to very hot 475°F/240°C/gas mark 9.<br />
38. Mix the egg with a teaspoon of water (or milk). Spread the egg wash across the tops of the croissants.<br />
39. Put the croissants in the oven for 12 to 15 minutes, until the tops are browned nicely.<br />
40. Take the croissants out of the oven, and place them on a rack to cool for 10 minutes before serving.</p>

<p>If you give these a try I would love to see the result so be sure to take pictures and send them my way. I’m hoping to give them another try soon. Best of luck and I look forward to sharing next month’s Daring Baker challenge with you all.</p>

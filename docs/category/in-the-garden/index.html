    <p>For some individuals, creativity seems to pour out with ease, turning everything they touch into creativity gold. For others, coming up with something creative is a more labored, time consuming process requiring hours of research scouring blogs and reading articles, testing recipes, practicing new techniques, ruining much anticipated projects, writing and rewriting, taking photo after photo after photo… Can you guess which one of these categories I fall into?</p>

<p>That’s right. I’m a “creativity is a painstaking process” personality and I wouldn’t trade it for the world. Because I have tried and failed at so many projects, I have branched out and discovered the world of creativity is ginormous! From childhood to now I’ve dabbled in drawing, beading, photography, scrapbooking, painting, cooking, sewing, baking, woodworking, furniture restoration, interior design, blogging, violin, photography again, flowers, flowers and more flowers. With so many different avenues to explore, how could I possibly settle on just one? If I <em>could</em> choose just one creative venture, perhaps I would find myself excelling, but until that day, the randomness of my projects will continue.</p>

<p>Now to what you all are wanting to see, flowers! Unfortunately, as Jack and I prepare for our big move to Austin, my time on the farm has slowed significantly. However, Kristin and I recently arranged a wedding for a Tennessee bride. The table arrangements were fairly simple–three wine bottles with three different arrangements in each. The showstopper was the bride’s bouquet (thank you Kristin). Kristin’s finished design was exquisite. We decided to wrap the stems in simple burlap with three pearl pins so nothing took away from the beautiful colors. The finished product: a bold and beautiful bridal bouquet.</p>

<p>It’s flower time on the farm! The hubby and I are preparing for a big move to the big land of Texas, of course that’s not about to stop me from enjoying a few last summer days on the farm. I spent the morning with my dear friend Kristin getting ready for a wedding this weekend. Linda was able to sneak away on a little vacation, so while she’s away, we get to play! Stay tuned this weekend for snapshots of our arranging.</p>

    <p>It is finally here, after 7 long years of dedicated studies I am finally graduating with my BSN degree! I must apologize for the lack of posting this semester, my mother’s mantra still rings in my head, “studies come first,” and so, blogging has taken a back seat. However, with graduation less than a week away I wanted to share with you a few images from my graduation celebration wishlist.</p>

<p>The following are ideas I’ve combined to make a Graduation Thyme Garden Party Celebration come to life. I hope these ideas spark your creativity as you prepare for your own graduation celebrations in the coming weeks.</p>

    <p>Today was my last farm day for the year. I’m always sad when summer comes to an end but with Fall just around the corner the workload at the farm dwindles down and really, it’s just in time for me to head back to classes. After seven years and three degree changes I am finally beginning my last year. Hooray! Next week I will head back to class and will also be starting a new job. Such a busy month. I am so excited to get started with the year and finish up this chapter of my life but right now, feeling sad to say goodbye to summer and all the beauty to be found out on the farm.</p>

<p>Today Linda and I worked on a rather unique wedding. The bride wanted purple and orange–not a request we are used to getting, however, the bouquets were both fun and beautiful. The groom’s boutonniere was purple and the groomsmen had orange. Like many of us, the happy couple also enjoy a good tasting beer and thought it would be fun to include hops in their bouts. Once again, so fun!</p>

<p>I hope you’ve enjoyed these pictures and found a little bit of inspiration. I never would have thought to use purple and orange for wedding colors but after putting these together, I’m a believer! I so loved arranging this fun wedding and wish the happy couple all the best.</p>

    <p>I feel like I say this every week but yesterday’s farm flowers were <em>gorgeous</em>! Seriously. Kristin took eight buckets of flowers to a wedding in Virginia. You would think with eight buckets gone we wouldn’t have many left to work with but that was not the case. Instead, we (Linda and I) made a record amount of market bouquets–a grand total of 50 (trust me, that’s a lot).</p>

<p>Linda asked if I wanted to make an arrangement for the altar on Sunday and I, of course, jumped on board immediately. It was really hard to not make something beautiful with the array of flowers we had to work with.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/07/pink-burgundy-altar-arrangement/pinkburgundyaltararrangement-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/07/pinkburgundyaltararrangement-2.jpg" alt="pink &amp; burgundy altar arrangement" title="pink&amp;burgundyaltararrangement (2)" /></a></p>

<p>This pink and burgundy arrangement is my finished product and I must say, I love it! Pitcher arrangements like these are perfect for a country wedding or for simply taking to church on Sunday to share with others.</p>

<p>Here’s how this pitcher arrangement came to be:</p>

<p>First I started with the large limelight hydrangea. I cut them down to size and angled one toward each side of the pitcher and one smaller one a bit higher in the back to provide a “back” to the bouquet (a place where the eye will stop looking).</p>

<p>Next, I added several bunches of dark pink lisianthus buds. These pop against the creamy-white hydrangeas and serve as a great filler since the mouth of my pitcher is so wide.</p>

<p>Then I added two stems of lilies, one low and one higher, each angled a separate direction.I also added a pink and white gladiola semi-centered. The lisianthus serve as support for keeping the lilies and gladiola securely in place.</p>

<p>Finally I filled in the gaps. Down low I added trailing amaranthus (that’s the pretty burgundy spilling over the edge), I also added bits of white and green filler (poke weed, grasses), a couple green/cream lisianthus and hot pink dianthus.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/07/pink-burgundy-altar-arrangement/pinkburgundyaltararrangement-1/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/07/pinkburgundyaltararrangement-1.jpg" alt="pink &amp; burgundy altar arrangement" title="pink&amp;burgundyaltararrangement (1)" /></a></p>

<p>Arrangements like these are fairly simple to create if you stick to a specific order when combining your flowers–heavy bulky stems first, delicate flowers next supported by the larger flowers, then smaller pops of color, collar greenery and delicate accents.</p>

<p>I hope you’ve enjoyed this mini-flower-arrangement lesson. Try your own pitcher arrangement at home, all it takes is a few stems from your own backyard.</p>

    <p>I am constantly writing to you about buying flowers locally and arranging them yourself for special events or weddings but what about those specialty pieces like corsages and boutonnieres? Can you also make these yourself? The answer is “yes &amp; yes” and I’m ready to show you how.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/07/how-to-boutonniere/bluegrayboutonniere-6/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/07/bluegrayboutonniere-6-575x382.jpg" alt="blue gray boutonniere how to" title="bluegrayboutonniere (6)" /></a></p>

<p>This little boutonniere is incredibly simple to make and uses items that are hardy enough to remain upright even when out of water overnight. When we make boutonnieres for weddings on the farm, they are usually assembled the afternoon prior to the wedding, at the same time we arrange centerpieces and bouquets. If you know what to use, this is not too far ahead of the event to assemble the boutonniere. Once you have finished assembling all your bouts, simply store in the refrigerator until the big event.</p>

<p>When choosing stems for your bout, be sure to choose ones that are hardy. This bout uses Ivy as the backing, dusty miller, blue thistle, dianthus and a small succulent.</p>

<p><em>Assembly:</em></p>

<p>Step 1: Find a flat surface and lay out one leaf of Ivy. Lay one leaf of Dusty Miller on top.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/07/how-to-boutonniere/bluegrayboutonniere-8/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/07/bluegrayboutonniere-8-575x411.jpg" alt="" title="bluegrayboutonniere (8)" /></a></p>

<p>Step 2: Now add a small piece of blue thistle on top of the Dusty Miller and slightly left of center.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/07/how-to-boutonniere/bluegrayboutonniere-1/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/07/bluegrayboutonniere-1-575x410.jpg" alt="blue gray boutonniere how to" title="bluegrayboutonniere (1)" /></a></p>

<p>Step 3: Lay the Dianthus to the right of the thistle.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/07/how-to-boutonniere/bluegrayboutonniere-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/07/bluegrayboutonniere-2-575x411.jpg" alt="blue gray boutonniere how to" title="bluegrayboutonniere (2)" /></a></p>

<p>Step 4: Push the succulent up under the Dianthus and slightly to the right of center. You should position the succulent so that it is sort of supporting the Dianthus, that way, even if it decides to wilt it will be supported and go unnoticed.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/07/how-to-boutonniere/bluegrayboutonniere-3/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/07/bluegrayboutonniere-3-575x411.jpg" alt="blue gray boutonniere how to" title="bluegrayboutonniere (3)" /></a></p>

<p>Step 5: Now you want to add a smaller Ivy leaf to the front of the bout, right underneath the succulent giving it a sort of clam-like appearance (sorry I forgot this picture, but look at the finished product up top and you will see what I mean).</p>

<p>Step 6: Pinch the stems together right underneath the heads of the stems and cut the stems and varying lengths. This is helpful for those of you who want to cover the stems with ribbon, it makes a gradual thickening as you up the stems toward the flowers.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/07/how-to-boutonniere/bluegrayboutonniere-4/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/07/bluegrayboutonniere-4-575x382.jpg" alt="blue gray boutonniere how to" title="bluegrayboutonniere (4)" /></a></p>

<p>Step 7: While holding the stems tightly with one hand, grab your roll of florist tape and begin to wrap the stems at the neck of the bout. If you just want a simple bout without ribbon, continue to wrap the stems all the way down with the florist tape (ribbon wrap tutorial to come).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/07/how-to-boutonniere/bluegrayboutonniere-5/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/07/bluegrayboutonniere-5-575x410.jpg" alt="blue gray boutonniere how to" title="bluegrayboutonniere (5)" /></a></p>

<p>There you have it, one <em>very</em> simple boutonniere crash course. Don’t forget to be creative with your materials–there are an endless possibilities when making your bout. One of my all-time favorite items to use is dried wheat or barley for a vintage look.</p>

    <p>For this week’s Friday at the Farm, we had our first bridal luncheon of the summer. In fact, the only bridal luncheon on the books this year. For those of you who are unfamiliar with this event, Linda gives our brides the option of having a bridal luncheon the day before their wedding. This luncheon allows the bride and bridesmaids to relax on the farm for a couple of hours and basically play with flowers. Sounds nice, right?!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/06/sweet-pink-bouquet-herbs/pinkbridesmaidbouquet-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/06/pinkbridesmaidbouquet-2-575x382.jpg" alt="pink bridesmaid bouquet" title="pinkbridesmaidbouquet (2)" /></a></p>

<p>We teach the ladies how to arrange their bouquets for the big day and, of course, help them as needed. Some brides and bridesmaids are quick to catch on to the techniques involved in hand-held-bouquet-making, others prefer to have us shape the bulk of their arrangement–either way, the bridal luncheons are fun for all.</p>

<p>Linda and I also arranged market bouquets following the luncheon festivities. Here is one of my favorite arrangements from the day. I also found a fantastic new picture spot on the farm–love this lighting.</p>

<p><em>Arrangement:</em> sweet peas, decorative sage, dianthus, mountain mint (smells SO good), oregano, goose neck</p>

    <p>This past week, the flower farm crew learned to stretch our imaginations a little bit farther than usual. This was the first time we were asked to arrange two weddings on the same day, and to make it a bit more interesting…two vastly different color palettes and settings.</p>

<p><em>Wedding #1:</em> flowy, wild &amp; bright; different flowers for each bouquet, outdoor wedding<br />
Flowers: grasses, mint, sunflowers, larkspur, black-eyed susans, lilies, bells of ireland, feverfew, campanula, and more.</p>

<p><em>Wedding #2:</em> neat, rounded bouquets, specific color pallet: periwinkle and raspberry, continuity across bouquets&amp; arrangements<br />
Flowers: blue, white and pink hydrangea (we even spray-painted a few–yes, this is an option), hot pink roses, snapdragons, holly, feverfew</p>

<p>We also made a grand total of 23 boutonnieres this week (trust me, that’s a lot).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/06/wedding-flower-girl-headband/flowergirlheadband/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/06/flowergirlheadband-325x419.jpg" alt="Flower Girl Headband Bright Colors" title="flowergirlheadband" /></a></p>

<p>Although vastly different in flowers and setting, both weddings were quite beautiful. My absolute favorite part of arranging these weddings, however, was the flower girl headbands. And, of course, I never took a finished photo of the pieces (grr). However, if you will excuse the sad, unfinished photos I can show you the headbands minus the ribbon.</p>

<p>I picked up these plastic headbands with a thin layer of foam on top in Walmart’s craft section for $1.17. To attach the flowers, I simply arranged two small grouping of flowers and greens in my hand and wrapped the stems with florist tape, as you would a boutonniere.</p>

<p>Next, I placed the larger grouping higher on the side of the headband, stem-ends facing down (toward your ear) and attached it to the headband by wrapping the stems to the band with florist tape. Then I took the smaller grouping and attached it to the band with stems facing up (toward the top of your head) and sort-of wedged under the flowers of the first grouping. So, the two flower bunches are facing each other (you can see the shape we are going for in the photo of Kristin’s yellow headband).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/06/wedding-flower-girl-headband/flowergirlheadband-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/06/flowergirlheadband1-325x216.jpg" alt="Flower Girl headband muted colors" title="flowergirlheadband" /></a></p>

<p>The last step, not shown here, is to wrap the ribbon of your choosing around the rest of the head band. I made a small knot under the edge of the flowers on each side (so it can’t be seen) and continued to wrap down toward the ends of the headband where I tied off the ribbon with another small knot.</p>

<p>I know that sounds a bit confusing but once you start the process, it comes pretty naturally. The brightly-colored headband is the one I made, the muted yellow one was made by my good friend Kristin who keeps me sane on those days I can’t seem to find a rhythm to my arranging. Don’t we all need one of those friends? I hope this has been an enjoyable read for you. Best of luck!</p>

    <p>Hello friends, Jack and I just got back from a mini-vacation to see the family–at least some of them. So, to make up for missing Floral Friday, here is a little post on a beautiful and bold wedding arrangement made for a bright wedding two weeks ago.</p>

<p>Seriously, isn’t this arrangement gorgeous?!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/06/bold-bright-wedding-arrangement/brightweddingflowers-1/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/06/brightweddingflowers-1-325x488.jpg" alt="Bright Wedding Flower Arrangement" title="brightweddingflowers (1)" /></a></p>

<p>I can’t get over how simple and breathtaking these flowers are, and so simple. Some of my favorite flowers are the ones that grow in mixed colors, you see this effect with flowers like Dahlias, which no one can deny they are beautiful. However, there is something about the pure colors–especially pure and bold like this arrangement.</p>

<p>This arrangement began in a pastel-colored pitcher but we discovered white was the only way to go. The flowers are gorgeous on their own and a colored pitcher didn’t make as big of a statement. Here’s another picture for you.</p>

<p><em>Stems:</em></p>

<p>Pink Peonies<br />
Magenta Snapdragons<br />
White Snapdragons<br />
Blue Delphinium<br />
Sunflowers<br />
Hosta Leaves<br />
Bells of Ireland<br />
Ornamental Grasses</p>

<p><em>Arrangement:</em></p>

<p>This arrangement starts out a bit different from what I normally recommend. There is not much filler used so I would start with your tall stems that are used most, in this case the snapdragons. Next, add in the little bit of filler–Bells of Ireland (the green things that look like bells–just in case you needed help with that).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/06/bold-bright-wedding-arrangement/brightweddingflowers-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/06/brightweddingflowers-2-575x382.jpg" alt="Bright Wedding Flower Arrangement" title="brightweddingflowers (2)" /></a></p>

<p>Now we need to focus on pulling the eye downward. Start by placing pink peonies low in the arrangement, nearly to the vase rim. The sunflowers have large stems so I would cut those lower than the snaps but higher than the peonies. Make sure you don’t cut them all the exact same height, you want these to be varied throughout the middle third of the arrangement height. Add these next since they will fill large holes and take up much of the vase space.</p>

<p>Now you can add the delicate-stemmed delphinium for beautiful pops of bluish-purple color. Finally add the Hosta leaves around the rim of the vase, as if cradling the peonies. Hosta leaves give the eye an end point for the arrangement.</p>

    <p>A few weeks ago I had the privilege of helping Linda with flower arrangements for a vintage wedding. If you haven’t figured it out before, it seems the go-to flower for vintage is the beautiful peony. And really, who would argue with that choice? The peony is absolutely exquisite in all colors but this coral color is by far my favorite. I could look at it for hours. Really? Not even kidding.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/05/coral-peony-bridal-bouquet/antiquewedding-3/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/05/antiquewedding-3-575x382.jpg" alt="" title="antiquewedding (3)" /></a></p>

<p>Here’s another look, in case you too, can’t stop staring.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/05/coral-peony-bridal-bouquet/antiquewedding-2-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/05/antiquewedding-2-575x382.jpg" alt="" title="antiquewedding (2)" /></a></p>

<p>Alrighty then, tearing eyes away, closing mouth, moving on…</p>

<p>The bridal bouquet was made mainly with white and coral peonies, white stock, yellow, white &amp; peach ranunculus, chartreuse-colored physocarpis, and bells of Ireland.</p>

<p>Bouquets are different than arrangements in styling order. With arrangements you typically want to start by placing your filler since that will take up more of the vase space. With bouquets however, filler is much more scarce so you actually begin with your flowers, and usually the bulkier flowers first to provide support to the smaller stems.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/05/coral-peony-bridal-bouquet/antiquewedding-5/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/05/antiquewedding-5-575x382.jpg" alt="" title="antiquewedding (5)" /></a></p>

<p>So, can you guess which flower we start with here? That’s right, the peonies! Group a few peonies in the middle, then add a white stock in between each peony. Then add a few Bells of Ireland stems around the edges of the peonies and stocks, follow with an outer layer of peonies in the open spaces.</p>

<p>As you move toward the outer edges of your bouquet, make sure you are continuing to push the outer edges upward instead of letting them fall low. With bridal and bridesmaid bouquets you want to see all of the flowers at the top, not lose them down underneath at the spot where you would hold the bouquet, make sense?</p>

<p>Alright, now all that’s left is filling in the spaces and adding a few pops of color and filler. This bouquet has Phisocarpus leaves placed sporadically throughout for a bit of added filler and little peach, white, and yellow Ranunculus for added color. Hold the bouquet lower on the stems as you add flowers. This allows the bouquet to sit loosely giving you plenty of wiggle room for adding stems in last minute or even pulling a few out.</p>

<p>And of course, if you like the look, add Hosta leaves around the very bottom to create a collar. This gives the eye an end point and keeps the focus on the flowers above the collar instead of trailing off into nothingness.</p>

<p>There are a few basic methods to arranging flowers. For an arrangement like the one shown above, it is best to start with your bulky flowers (the white lilacs) as those take up a lot of space and make filling in the rest of the arrangement fairly simple. Place 3-5 stems of lilacs of varying heights in your container–the number of stems depends on their size and the size of your container. Angle each stem in a different direction (or if they are smaller you can try grouping).</p>

<p>With an arrangement this size I would next fill in with greenery to add support and stability to your lilacs, also providing a sturdy base for the more delicate flowers. The greenery in this arrangement is simply the drooping foliage from a lilac bush on the farm. Make sure you add greenery both around the lip of the container, giving it the spillover effect, as well as tall and short stems in and around the lilacs to add dimension.</p>

<p>Next, add your color. This is usually a more delicate stem, so be sure to place gently and secure well amid the greenery. Linda used tulips for her color.</p>

<p>Finally, in order to really make the tulips stand out, Linda added a chartreuse color of greenery to the mix. Chartreuse greenery is one of my all-time favorite items to add to arrangements. Although dark greenery is pretty, it is still dark, making your one bright color a big leap from the dark green. The chartreuse color bridges this dark-light gap and allows the brightness of the flower to pop while keeping the overall arrangement in balance. The chartreuse-colored stem in this arrangement is physocarpus.</p>

<p>The wonderful thing about this arrangement is most people with a garden have these flowers. The flowers are not anything out of the ordinary and you can substitute the greenery with just about any shrub or decorative grass in your own backyard.</p>

<p>I hope you’ve enjoyed these quick and simple steps to building a beautiful flower arrangement for your home. Happy arranging!</p>

    <p>Today was another Bird’s Nest workshop out at <a href="http://www.auntwillieswildflowers.com">Aunt Willie’s Wildlflowers</a>. These are just a few of the photos from the day. We ate a delicious pasta salad, rolls, and strawberry almond salad. So healthy!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/03/bird-nest-workshop/birds-nest-ws-20121-001/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/03/Birds-Nest-WS-20121-001-575x359.jpg" alt="" title="Bird's Nest WS 2012-3" /></a></p>

<p>Everything on the farm is blooming early thanks to our mild winter so there are more flowers than usual right now. This is wonderful for viewing, not so great for the upcoming wedding season. I suppose we can’t complain too much with all these beauties.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/03/bird-nest-workshop/birds-nest-ws-2012/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/03/Birds-Nest-WS-2012-575x359.jpg" alt="" title="Bird's Nest WS 2012" /></a></p>

<p>These handcrafted bird’s nest are the perfect table decoration for your upcoming Easter get-together. Check out how to make one for yourself and be sure to view more photos from the day over on our <a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/farm-photos/">“Farm Photos”</a> tab.</p>

<p><em>Supplies:</em></p>

<p>1 small straw wreath<br />
1 cardboard circle that matches the wreath size<br />
1 spool of paddle wire<br />
1 small bag of fake moss<br />
1 bag of two-pronged pins<br />
moss, nuts, dried flowers, lichen, and any other decoration from nature you can think of</p>

<p><em>Instructions:</em></p>

<p>1. Take your fake moss and cover the straw wreath, wrapping it loosely with paddle wire as you move around the wreath. Twist the paddle wire together once the entire wreath is covered. You really just need to make sure no straw is showing on the sides because the real moss will cover the top of the wreath.<br />
2. Using hot glue, attach the cardboard circle to the bottom of your wreath. This will keep your moss and pretties from falling through.<br />
3. Take various colors and textures of moss and fill the wreath hole and various parts of the top of your wreath. You can use as much or as little moss as you’d like for this part. One of our farm ladies today covered her entire wreath in moss and other just had little trails of moss coming out of the center and over the edges.<br />
4. Now use dried hydrangea, daffodils, dogwood, nuts, lichen, twigs, wheat, grasses and anything else you can find to decorate the rim of your nest. This year, I used blue hydrangea bunches on each side, pussy willow branches, feathers, dried pods, larkspur, and artemisia to decorate.<br />
5. Once all your decor is secured in place with pins or hot glue, drop in a few candy eggs and your bird’s nest is complete!</p>

    <p>Spring is in the air here in East Tennessee and our household is gearing up for another attempt at container gardening. Although we love our little apartment, one very unfortunate downside is the inability to put our budding green thumbs to work. Since Jack and I very much enjoy the labors of tending a garden, we had to figure out a way to make due without a plot of land.</p>

<p>Our first year in Tennessee, we purchased a few inexpensive starter pots for a bit of trial and error in East Tennessee growing. The second year, we got smarter. We borrowed three large cylinder buckets from Linda out at <a href="http://www.auntwillieswildflowers.com">Aunt Willies Wildflowers</a> that were deep enough to allow better root growth for larger plants. The buckets aren’t pretty but our tomatoes grew much bigger and stronger because of them. We also attempted to put together our <a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/diy-planter-box/">first planter box</a>. When this project was attempted however, Jack did not own his own saw or a decent drill so we relied heavily on the great staff over at Home Depot to make the appropriate cuts for us.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/03/how-to-build-a-planter-box/planter-box-1/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/03/planter-box-1-325x403.jpg" alt="" title="planter-box-1" /></a></p>

<p>This last Christmas, Jack was gifted a new saw and drill (you can imagine how much our neighbors are loving us this Spring). Jack’s biggest goal with his new toys has been building wall book shelves that work around his desk. This is a slow process and we have had some extra wood pieces lying around the house because of the project. Last weekend, with the beautiful weather beckoning us outdoors, we decided to get the porch ready for planting and since we had the materials, we decided to build our second planter box too. This one is WAY better!</p>

<p>I asked the lovely husband to write up these simple instructions for those of you looking to container garden this spring.<br />
Please don’t hesitate to shoot us an email if you have any questions.</p>
<nbsp>  
_Tools &amp; Materials:_</nbsp>

<p>Plywood sheet-whatever size you want (we used 3/4″ plywood that was 8′ x 14″)<br />
8 L-Brackets<br />
1 package of Screen Door nylon<br />
Wide head tacks or staple gun<br />
1 extra piece of lumber-(4′ 1×4)<br />
Wood screws or nails</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/03/how-to-build-a-planter-box/planter-box-2-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/03/planter-box-21-325x244.jpg" alt="" title="planter-box-2" /></a><em>Directions:</em></p>

<ol>
  <li>Cut four equal (and they really do need to be equal!) lengths of wood (I used some scrap 3/4” plywood that was 8′ x 14”).</li>
  <li>Attach L-brackets to each side, forming a square.</li>
  <li>Cut a sufficient amount of screen material to cover the bottom of the box (I use twice as much and doubled it over).</li>
  <li>Using a staple gun (or tacks with a wide head) fasten the screen material to the bottom of the box, keeping it tight.</li>
  <li>Fold the excess screen material back inward (under the box) and staple it. This serves a two-fold purpose—it gives some strength to the staples (in case the screen rips) and it hides the excess without having to cut it off.</li>
  <li>Cut two equal lengths of a smaller kind of lumber (I used a 4′ 1×4) and miter the ends at a 45º angle, making each look like a trapezoid (viz. not a parallellogram).</li>
  <li>Screw (or nail, if you’re brave) the two 1x4s to the bottom of the box diagonally.</li>
</ol>

<p>That’s it! The quick and dirty way to throw together a planter box for Spring. Of course, you can grab some outdoor stain or sealant if you’d like to further protect the box. We, however, have come to like the gray, weathered look of our first box and thus decided not to treat the wood at all.</p>

<p>I hope this helps. Once again feel free to email us with any questions or clarification needs.</p>

<p>Happy Building!</p>

    <p>Working on a cut-flower farm is not the idealized job I once thought it to be. No, I used to think cutting flowers all day would be simple, relaxing, and inspiring. Although at times cutting can be all of these things, more often working on the farm can be summed up as painful, dirty, and sweaty. Let me assure you, the cut-flower life is not one to be entered into lightly. Although aspects are very rewarding it is a difficult job–and this from someone who only works on the farm once a week.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/03/springs-sprouts/dsc_0059-001/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/03/DSC_0059-001-575x381.jpg" alt="" title="Farm Sunset" /></a></p>

<p>I spent a few days this week, my spring break, helping Linda out at <a href="www.auntwillieswildflowers.com">Aunt Willies Wildflowers</a>. What do I have to show for my hard work? Sunburns, callouses, 50-or-so cuts and scrapes (and no, I am in <em>no way</em> complaining) and of course a few photos just for you. For me, the hard work and painfully sore nights are worth being outside and enjoying the daily surprises of nature.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/03/springs-sprouts/dsc_0017/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/03/DSC_0017-575x381.jpg" alt="" title="DSC_0017" /></a></p>

<p>In the early months of spring, we (and I mean mostly Roy and Linda) take on a variety of tasks to prepare for the cutting season. These tasks include the following:<br />
-fill seed trays (each holding upwards of 200 seedlings at a time)<br />
-hoe flower beds<br />
-stake down landscape fabric<br />
-transplant seedlings into the hoophouse<br />
-clear dead bushes and plants<br />
-weed for hours on end.<br />
Getting the farm ready for the cutting season is a very dirty job, but of course, someone has to do it.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/03/springs-sprouts/dsc_0022-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/03/DSC_0022-575x381.jpg" alt="" title="DSC_0022" /></a></p>

<p>I took these photos to give you an idea of how barren the farm can seem early in the season and how incredibly fast the plants grow to fill all this empty space (check out last year’s images under <a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/farm-photos/">“Farm Photos”</a> to get an idea). It never ceases to amaze me how many new plants are sprouting each week.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/03/springs-sprouts/dsc_0069-001/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/03/DSC_0069-001-575x381.jpg" alt="" title="Sprouts" /></a></p>

<p>One month from now these empty beds will be full of flowers so hang on to your britches and keep checking back with us because them cuttin’ days are coming.</p>

<p>The bowl is from Wal-Mart and only cost $2.50. I used stones, tree bark, privet berries, and a pine cone.I took the pine cone and peeled off a few of the layers, sticking them upright into the middle of the dish to add texture and break up the scene.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/03/mini-moss-terrarium/dsc_0010/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/03/DSC_0010-575x381.jpg" alt="" title="Moss #2" /></a></p>

<p>Remember you can use absolutely anything to make your terrarium–weeds, twigs, succulents, stones, moss, leaves… For taller containers, I would recommend starting with dirt, followed by small pebbles or stones, and finally your greenery to help add lots of textural contrast. See the link below for a good example of this.</p>

<p>There are many varieties of terrariums to make…Jack and I have been debating either a Hobbit Hole terrarium or maybe even this <a href="http://www.yellowbrickhome.com/2011/04/19/dino-battle-and-building-a-terrarium/">Dinosaur terrarium</a>, which just happens to be my favorite!</p>

<p>If you decide to brave the terrarium project, be sure to send us a photo! Happy Sunday!</p>

    <p>I’ve realized over the past year that I am much better at capturing the small details of our farm workshops than I am at photographing the people involved. Perhaps it’s because the objects don’t move, or maybe it has to do with their vivid colors. Either way, I thought I would share a few of my favorite photos from last week’s cooking lesson and moss workshop.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/02/setting-the-scene/dsc_0044/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/02/DSC_0044-575x381.jpg" alt="" title="DSC_0044" /></a></p>

<p>These photos capture unique aspects of the atmosphere we try to create out at <a href="http://www.auntwillieswildflowers.com">Aunt Willie’s Wildflowers</a>–quaint, old-fashioned, peaceful–although nature has already done most of the work for us. Whatever words these might bring to mind, I hope they make you take pause and think about the little details in your own life that you may be overlooking every day.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/02/setting-the-scene/dsc_0068/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/02/DSC_0068-575x381.jpg" alt="" title="DSC_0068" /></a></p>

<p>When planning a dinner party, birthday, or wedding, don’t forget the impact little details have on the event and on the way you remember it years later.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/02/setting-the-scene/dsc_0140/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/02/DSC_0140-575x381.jpg" alt="" title="DSC_0140" /></a></p>

<p>Be sure to check back with us soon for an incredible guest post from my friend, Kira, of <a href="http://www.kiranoblephotographyblog.com/">Kira Noble Photography</a>, on how to best photograph the little details.</p>

<p>Aren’t they beautiful? Yes, I realize it is only January and many of you are knee deep in water (I’m talking to my friends and family on the West Coast), but with any luck all those showers will bring pretty flowers!</p>

<p>I decided it was appropriate to talk about flowers this week after receiving an unexpected email. <em>The</em> email. The one that comes every spring from Linda at <a href="http://auntwillieswildflowers.com/">Aunt Willie’s Wildflowers</a> saying it’s time to talk about this year’s workshop schedule. Hooray!</p>

<p>In celebration of the upcoming flower season, and simply because I’m SO excited, I thought I would share a few links with you all.</p>

<p>First off, Linda made her monthly appearance on <a href="http://www2.daytimetricities.com/lifestyles/2012/jan/17/1/planning-your-flowers-for-a-2012-wedding-46271-vi-33913/">Daytime Tricities</a> to show off a few arrangements and advertise for spring weddings.</p>

<p>The second link I have for you is to <a href="http://auntwillies.wordpress.com/">Linda’s blog</a>. That’s right, she started a blog! Now you can see even more farm pictures. Her latest post shows a moss crystal basket arrangement.</p>

<p>I am also giving you the link to the <a href="http://www.kiranoblephotographyblog.com/2012/01/the-small-things/">latest post from Kira Noble Photography</a>. Kira gives readers some great tips for photographing the small things/little details…I think flowers count as small things so this post might be beneficial for the budding florists/photographers among us.</p>

<p>And one more link with pretty flower arrangements from <a href="http://www.flirtyfleurs.com/eye-candy-from-florali/">Flirty Fleurs</a>.</p>

<p>I hope this post has sparked your imagination and served to prepare you just a bit for the exiting season ahead.</p>

    <p>The past two weekends have been full of wedding frenzy. Two weekends ago, I helped out a friend by coordinating her special day and this past weekend, Kristin and I hosted a bridal luncheon for a sweet bride out at the farm. Linda was on a family vacation so it was up to us to plan the luncheon, cater, and put together the arrangements for the wedding. So, although busy, it has been a fun two weeks. I’m now thinking my nursing degree may be the financial backing for an event planning/flower arranging/catering hobby, if indeed you can call that a “hobby.” Now I just need some clients.</p>

<p>Anyways, back to the wedding…the ceremony was held at Munsey United Methodist Church, which has one of the most exquisite sanctuaries (see below). The bride was very laid back (which we always appreciate) and was happy to use whatever was blooming on the farm for the arrangements. Lucky for her, there are lots and lots of beautiful flowers blooming on the farm right now.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/07/munsey-wedding/mushrooms-wedding-zucchini-192/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/07/mushrooms-wedding-zucchini-192-575x356.jpg" alt="" title="Munsey Church" /></a></p>

<p>We tied shepherd’s hooks to the ends of the aisles with raffia and hung ball jars on each filled with a variety of wildflowers. The sanctuary is very large and to line every row with flowers, although exquisite, would have been very expensive. Instead, we adorned every other aisle for the first 10 rows. I was worried the flowers might get lost in the sanctuary but was pleasantly surprised with the finished result.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/07/munsey-wedding/mushrooms-wedding-zucchini-184/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/07/mushrooms-wedding-zucchini-184-575x381.jpg" alt="" title="Ball Jars and Shepherd's Hooks" /></a></p>

<p>Here’s a close-up of one of our ball jars for you.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/07/munsey-wedding/mushrooms-wedding-zucchini-181-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/07/mushrooms-wedding-zucchini-1811-575x381.jpg" alt="" title="Ball Jar and Shepherd's Hook" /></a></p>

<p>The front of the sanctuary has a set of stairs, followed by a choir loft and then a back altar area, all very intricate. In order to not have the main arrangements overshadowed, they had to be big, bold, and beautiful. I think we succeeded!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/07/munsey-wedding/mushrooms-wedding-zucchini-144-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/07/mushrooms-wedding-zucchini-1441-575x381.jpg" alt="" title="Main Arrangements" /></a></p>

<p>Here’s a close-up of the main arrangements. These are compiled of sunflowers, lisianthus, feathered black-eyed susans and various grasses.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/07/munsey-wedding/mushrooms-wedding-zucchini-131-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/07/mushrooms-wedding-zucchini-1311-325x489.jpg" alt="" title="Main Arrangement #1" /></a></p>

<p>At the bridal luncheon on Friday, I helped our bride, Anna, put together her bouquet. The final arrangement consisted of dahlias, zinnias, limelight hydrangeas, and lisianthus. The green collar around the outside is a bubby bush, which is also commonly referred to as either sweet shrub or carolina allspice.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/07/munsey-wedding/mushrooms-wedding-zucchini-145-1-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/07/mushrooms-wedding-zucchini-145-11-575x443.jpg" alt="" title="Bride's Bouquet" /></a></p>

<p>I also braided ribbon down the stem of her bouquet.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/07/munsey-wedding/mushrooms-wedding-zucchini-149/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/07/mushrooms-wedding-zucchini-149-325x489.jpg" alt="" title="Bride's Bouquet with Braided Ribbon" /></a></p>

<p>Kristin and I used lisianthus buds, frosted explosion, ivy leaves, and blue thistle to make a few varieties of boutonnieres.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/07/munsey-wedding/mushrooms-wedding-zucchini-119/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/07/mushrooms-wedding-zucchini-119-575x404.jpg" alt="" title="Groomsmen Bout" /></a></p>

<p>Ball Jar Arrangements:</p>

<p>Shasta Daisies, Dahlias, Green Zinnias, Pink Lisianthus</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/07/munsey-wedding/mushrooms-wedding-zucchini-162/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/07/mushrooms-wedding-zucchini-162-325x448.jpg" alt="" title="Shasta Daisies, Dahlias, Green Zinnias, PInk Lisianthus" /></a></p>

<p>Zinnias and Sunflowers</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/07/munsey-wedding/mushrooms-wedding-zucchini-173/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/07/mushrooms-wedding-zucchini-173-325x489.jpg" alt="" title="Zinnias and Sunflowers" /></a></p>

<p>Pink Zinnia, Lisianthus, Ageratum</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/07/munsey-wedding/mushrooms-wedding-zucchini-169/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/07/mushrooms-wedding-zucchini-169-325x459.jpg" alt="" title="Pink Zinnia, Lisianthus, Ageratum" /></a></p>

<p>This wedding was simple and elegant, a combination I love. As you can see, wedding or event flowers do not have to match to go together and be beautiful. You can mix a wide variety of flowers, fillers, and color and still end up with a unified presentation.</p>

<p>I hope these wedding pictures give you a bit of inspiration today. Happy arranging!</p>

    <p>Last summer I bought these cute little yellow glass lanterns at a thrift store for $2. I liked the yellow because it is summer color, but this yellow was too dark for my tastes. My solution? Spray paint. A few days ago, while going through my nightly routine of catching up on the 48 or so blogs I have bookmarked, I saw these lanterns that were painted with a glow-in-the-dark paint (which was awesome). I, however, couldn’t justify spending the money on glow in the dark paint for just one project. Instead, I chose an indoor/outdoor $.97 can of pure white, thinking by the time I put a candle inside it’ll glow all by itself. I know, I’m pretty clever like that.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/07/spray-paint-patio-lights/bracelet-tote-taco-lasagna-066/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/06/bracelet-tote-taco-lasagna-066-575x381.jpg" alt="" title="bracelet, tote, taco lasagna 066" /></a></p>

<p>Can I just say, that although these almost look like little milk jugs, I absolutely love the finished product. The paint has an almost marbled look with tiny hints of yellow showing through which give it lots of texture. I have the lanterns sitting in between my pepper plants at the moment just waiting for me to attach them to the our porch railing.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/07/spray-paint-patio-lights/bracelet-tote-taco-lasagna-068/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/06/bracelet-tote-taco-lasagna-068-575x865.jpg" alt="" title="bracelet, tote, taco lasagna 068" /></a></p>

<p>If you have old jars, tins, or frames that you think you will never display in your home, don’t discount the power a new coat of paint can make, turning old and grungy into new and modern.</p>

    <p>This past Friday, I helped Linda host a beautiful bridal luncheon. The weather was fantastic, sitting in the mid-eighties and the flowers were absolutely exquisite.</p>

<p>The bride requested only white flowers for her big day and, in the end, decided to add a few splashes of green to the palette. We have never before catered to an all-white wedding at Aunt Willies Wildflowers but the combination of flowers turned out to be my favorite yet. So much so that I spent the entire day mentally redesigning my own wedding.</p>

<p>So, are you wondering which beautiful flowers we were able to work with?</p>

<p>Spider Mums<br />
<a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/farm-photos/img_2094/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/06/IMG_2094-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="IMG_2094" /></a></p>

<p>Roses<br />
<a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/farm-photos/img_2110/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/06/IMG_2110-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="white roses" /></a></p>

<p>Poppy Pods and Hosta Leaves<br />
<a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/farm-photos/img_2103/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/06/IMG_2103-575x766.jpg" alt="" title="poppy pods" /></a></p>

<p>Lilies<br />
<a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/farm-photos/img_2101/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/06/IMG_2101-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="white lilies" /></a></p>

<p>Artemisia<br />
<a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/farm-photos/img_2102/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/06/IMG_2102-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="IMG_2102" /></a></p>

<p>As you can see from the following pictures, the finished bouquets were beautiful.</p>

<p>Bouquet #1<br />
<a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/06/white-wedding-bridal-luncheon/img_2111/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/06/IMG_2111-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="Wedding bouquet" /></a></p>

<p>Bouquet #2<br />
<a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/06/white-wedding-bridal-luncheon/img_2114/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/06/IMG_2114-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="IMG_2114" /></a></p>

<p>Bouquet #3<br />
<a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/06/white-wedding-bridal-luncheon/img_2118/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/06/IMG_2118-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="IMG_2118" /></a></p>

<p>Bouquet #4 (I think this is actually 3 bouquets together.)<br />
<a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/06/white-wedding-bridal-luncheon/img_2122/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/06/IMG_2122-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="IMG_2122" /></a></p>

<p>Bride’s Bouquet<br />
<a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/06/white-wedding-bridal-luncheon/img_2123/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/06/IMG_2123-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="Bride's Bouquet" /></a></p>

<p>I would highly recommend this color scheme for those of you in the midst of planning your wedding. These flowers (except the lilies) are also relatively inexpensive to purchase.</p>

<p>I hope you’ve enjoyed these pictures from my day on the farm. Be sure to check out more flower images in the “Farm Photos” tab.</p>

    <p>Spring is here! After having almost an entire week of beautiful sun, we had one of the first big thunderstorms of spring last night.<br />
When we first moved to Tennessee, I never thought I would get used to the crashing thunder and giant bolts of lightning. Now, I love hearing the sound of heavy raindrops falling on the roof or slamming up against our glass door as the wind whips them every which way. It is soothing to listen to the rain and humbling to think about its mighty power.</p>

<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-fmPP7imBmTM/TYtDABgPmqI/AAAAAAAAAQE/kRnsFJArmpM/s1600/crafty%2B014.JPG"><br />
</a></p>

<p>In honor of what the beautiful sun and mighty rains bring to us each year (FLOWERS!), I thought I would post some simple arrangements thrown together at the farm in hopes of igniting creativity with your flowers at home.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/arrangements-from-the-garden/crafty-014-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/crafty-014-325x433.jpg" alt="" title="crafty 014" /></a></p>

<p>These arrangements are so simple. Grab one main flower and throw in leaves, grasses, ferns, anything you can find popping up in your backyard or even along the side of the road.</p>

<p>I love color so picking one or two main flowers that are bright and contrasting is my go-to plan. Hosta leaves, honeysuckle vines, grasses, and ferns are great fillers that you can find just about anywhere.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/arrangements-from-the-garden/img_0401-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/IMG_0401-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="IMG_0401" /></a></p>

<p>When in doubt, go simple. If you have lots of one beautiful flower, like this next picture, simply throw them all in a plain vase or pitcher to make the flowers stand out.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/arrangements-from-the-garden/flowers-041-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/flowers-041-325x433.jpg" alt="" title="flowers 041" /></a></p>

<p>Don’t worry about making your arrangements perfect and static like FTD. Fun, loose, and wild is the way to go… at least with flowers.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/arrangements-from-the-garden/crafty-011-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/crafty-011-325x433.jpg" alt="" title="crafty 011" /></a></p>

<p>Peonies are a beautiful and full flower. They are abundant around Mother’s Day and make arranging easy and quick. Below is a simple arrangement with only peonies and dianthus.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/arrangements-from-the-garden/flowers-007/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/flowers-007-325x433.jpg" alt="" title="flowers 007" /></a></p>

<p>And of course, daffodils are the perfect spring flower. These bright beauties are perfect by themselves. If you decide to combine them with another plant like forsythia (which is blooming everywhere here in T-town), be sure to wash the stems to get rid of their sap. It is not friendly to other plants.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/arrangements-from-the-garden/flowers-090-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/flowers-090-325x460.jpg" alt="" title="flowers 090" /></a></p>

<p>I hope these pictures have sparked some ideas. Now, go take a walk and explore the wide variety of spring plants and shrubs that will add the perfect flair to your arrangements. Be creative. Good luck and happy spring!</p>

    <p>While Jack and I absolutely love our little Tennessee home, living in an apartment has certain disadvantages. Aside from the constant din of teenage neighbor girls bickering over a borrowed sweater, we have no land to garden!</p>

<p>Some might consider this a blessing, never having to mow the lawn or weed the garden, but me, I crave the dirt. There are few things that compare to being outside with the sun on your shoulders and your hands in the ground.</p>

<p>Last summer, Jack and I were surprised to find a ridiculous amount of planting pots available in stores but a severe lack of planting boxes, at least ones that didn’t jump into the hundreds of dollars range. All I wanted was to plant some veggies on our porch and pretend we had our own secret garden.</p>

<p>My dear husband, always willing to help with my ill-planned schemes, devised this simple box to show off my veggies. Did we research how to best go about this task? No, of course not, that would be silly right? Well, the plan worked, mostly. (I’ll get to the “what we learned” section at the end.)</p>

<p>We went to our local Home Depot and figured out the cheapest way to build the planter box, ended up being about $25. We bought two pine boards and had them cut into the following measurements:</p>

<p><strong>Measurements:</strong></p>

<p>1-10ft 1×12<br />
1-3ft 2×2<br />
Cutting Directions<br />
Cut 1×12 into 2-1ft sections and 2-4ft sections<br />
Cut 2×2 into 3-1ft sections<br />
Other Materials<br />
Screen door mesh (or some other screening with tiny holes)<br />
Screws</p>

<p>Build a Planter Box</p>

<p>Hopefully, the cutting makes sense. Next is simply a matter of piecing all the boards together. Obviously, your shorter boards are your ends and the longer, your sides. Assemble the pieces using screws (We used nails, but don’t do it. More on this later.)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/diy-planter-box/img_0238/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/IMG_0238-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="IMG_0238" /></a></p>

<p>After the four main boards are nailed together, attach the netting to the bottom of the box. This will help drain water, without draining dirt as well.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/diy-planter-box/img_0240/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/IMG_0240-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="IMG_0240" /></a></p>

<p>Next, attach the 2×2 blocks over the top of the netting, one toward each end and one in the middle. We did this mostly to keep it up off of the porch so there would be no rotting underneath from the drainage.<br />
Flip it over and you have a box for planting in!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/diy-planter-box/img_0247/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/IMG_0247-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="IMG_0247" /></a></p>

<p>Now, a couple things to think about and adjust.Our box worked wonderfully for the summer but had a few issues as we neared the end of growing season.</p>

<p>We used nails to piece our boards together, but with dirt and the expanding roots, eventually the pressure inside the box started to push out the nails and the boards began to separate.</p>

<p><strong>Suggestion #1:</strong> use screws, not nails</p>

<p>Also, in Tennessee we have quite a few thunderstorms throughout the summer and the wood took a bit of a beating.</p>

<p><strong>Suggestion #2:</strong> try using a different type of wood, one that is more hardy, or try treating it with some sort of outdoor weather sealer<br />
I think that about covers it all. I think this year we are going to try to make smaller individuals boxes instead of the long one and maybe paint them to add more color to the porch! Best of luck and happy growing!</p>

<p>Today was the first workshop of spring out at <a href="http://www.auntwillieswildflowers.com/">Aunt Willie’s Wildflowers</a>. Twelve women from a local gardening club donned their boots and made the trek out to the farm for a bird’s nest workshop (pictures on website).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/spring-on-the-farm/on-the-farm-012-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/On-the-Farm-012-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="On the Farm 012" /></a></p>

<p>I went out to the farm yesterday to help Linda clean up the homeplace and make a few arrangements. We were so excited to be back outside working with the flowers. Yes, you heard right, flowers already! East Tennessee has had quite a few warm days making many of the flowers at Aunt Willies bloom early. This morning was sunny and with all the colorful flowers, I just had to take a few pictures to share with you all.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/spring-on-the-farm/on-the-farm-009/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/On-the-Farm-009-325x443.jpg" alt="" title="On the Farm 009" /></a></p>

<p>I couldn’t believe how many arrangements we were able to make from the early bloomers. Small, white pitchers made the spring colors pop. Don’t worry about not having much green filler to add to your arrangements, simple and loose combinations work well with these vibrant spring flowers.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/spring-on-the-farm/on-the-farm-007/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/On-the-Farm-007-325x534.jpg" alt="" title="On the Farm 007" /></a></p>

<p>These three pitchers in the window are my favorite arrangement location at the farm. We always have one stem of whatever is blooming in each pitcher. The simplicity of this arrangement against the beautiful landscape outside the window always makes a statement.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/spring-on-the-farm/on-the-farm-005-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/On-the-Farm-005-325x433.jpg" alt="" title="On the Farm 005" /></a></p>

<p>So, for those of you with a few bulbs popping out of the ground, grab your favorite jars or pitchers, cut a few stems, and bring some glorious spring into your home.</p>

<p>The Doans run a specialty cut-flower farm called <em>Aunt Willie’s Wildflowers</em>. Linda spends most of the spring and summer growing cut flowers for farmer’s markets. She also teaches various flower arranging workshops and arranges flowers for weddings. Her workshops feature a variety of creative arrangements–from teapots to stumps, you name it, she can arrange in it. Check out Linda’s website <a href="http://auntwillieswildflowers.com/">Aunt Willie’s Wildflowers</a>.</p>

<p>Linda used this centerpiece for one of the workshops last spring and I, of course, fell in love with the idea. All she did was take an old chicken feeder, fill it with soil &amp; plant multiple lettuce varieties. The centerpiece at the workshop lunch was this feeder and the ladies were able to pick leaves of lettuce to add to their salads.</p>

<p>For any of you looking to bring a bit of country to your next get together, I highly recommend giving this a try.</p>

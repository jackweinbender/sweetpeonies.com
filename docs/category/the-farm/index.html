    <p>For some individuals, creativity seems to pour out with ease, turning everything they touch into creativity gold. For others, coming up with something creative is a more labored, time consuming process requiring hours of research scouring blogs and reading articles, testing recipes, practicing new techniques, ruining much anticipated projects, writing and rewriting, taking photo after photo after photo… Can you guess which one of these categories I fall into?</p>

<p>That’s right. I’m a “creativity is a painstaking process” personality and I wouldn’t trade it for the world. Because I have tried and failed at so many projects, I have branched out and discovered the world of creativity is ginormous! From childhood to now I’ve dabbled in drawing, beading, photography, scrapbooking, painting, cooking, sewing, baking, woodworking, furniture restoration, interior design, blogging, violin, photography again, flowers, flowers and more flowers. With so many different avenues to explore, how could I possibly settle on just one? If I <em>could</em> choose just one creative venture, perhaps I would find myself excelling, but until that day, the randomness of my projects will continue.</p>

<p>Now to what you all are wanting to see, flowers! Unfortunately, as Jack and I prepare for our big move to Austin, my time on the farm has slowed significantly. However, Kristin and I recently arranged a wedding for a Tennessee bride. The table arrangements were fairly simple–three wine bottles with three different arrangements in each. The showstopper was the bride’s bouquet (thank you Kristin). Kristin’s finished design was exquisite. We decided to wrap the stems in simple burlap with three pearl pins so nothing took away from the beautiful colors. The finished product: a bold and beautiful bridal bouquet.</p>

    <p>My dear friend Laura was married at the end of September. I offered to help out by arranging her wedding flowers, a task I was a little nervous about because, as we all know, flower options become a bit more limited the farther you get into the Fall season. However, Laura was incredibly easygoing about the flowers and pretty much gave me the criteria of “I just want something pretty.”</p>

<p>The wedding was held at a little local church on a college campus, with a river running along one side–idyllic right? The reception was held just down the road at Meredith Valley Farms, this venue has some of the most beautiful views of the Tennessee hills I have ever seen. The weather was a bit stormy throughout the afternoon but you would have never known by looking at the joy on the bride and groom’s faces as well as the sheer happiness on the faces of all those in attendance.</p>

<p>Because of the simple and natural elements involved in this wedding, we decided to make the bouquets and arrangements very natural and free–everything you might think of when it comes to wildflowers. All of the flowers came from Linda’s farm, <a href="http://auntwillieswildflowers.com">Aunt Willies Wildflowers</a>.</p>

<p>Hannah Bader, a friend of mine and local photographer, served as their wedding photographer and snapped a couple of photos for me at the service. Hannah’s photography includes weddings, portraits, and events. She approaches her photography from a photo-journalistic/environmental portraiture approach. The following are just a few of the photos she took downstairs as I was finishing some final bouquet details (more photos to come).</p>

    <p>During my two week hiatus from posting, Jack and I have been very busy baking 300 cookies, arranging wedding flowers, attending baby showers, and attempting to stay afloat with school and work. Yesterday my friend Laura was married at <a href="http://www.meredithvalleyfarm.com/">Meredith Valley Farms</a>. This farm is seriously so so beautiful. They have small cabins you can rent down on the river and a beautiful large cabin up on the hill for wedding guests to rent during the event weekend. And of course, the views are stunning.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/09/farmstyle-wedding-corsage/rustic-wildflower-corsage-1/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/09/rustic-wildflower-corsage-1-575x382.jpg" alt="rustic wildflower corsage" title="rustic wildflower corsage (1)" /></a></p>

<p>I arranged the flowers for Laura’s wedding. You would think there would not be many flowers to work with for an end of September wedding but even I was pleasantly surprised at the variety of colors still available on the farm. Laura wanted a very “wildflower” look to her arrangements and I think we accomplished just that. I will be posting more pictures of the bouquets soon but for now I thought I would share one of the 22 boutonnieres and corsages that I made for the event.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/09/farmstyle-wedding-corsage/rustic-wildflower-corsage-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/09/rustic-wildflower-corsage-2-325x488.jpg" alt="rustic wildflower corsage" title="rustic wildflower corsage (2)" /></a></p>

<p>This corsage was for the mothers of the bride and groom. Included in the corsage is a small dahlia, purple sage, goldenrod, dusty miller, sedum and a little weed. I tied all the corsages, bouts, and bouquets with yellow raffia to continue the rustic wildflower theme.</p>

    <p>The past two weeks have absolutely flown by. As you know, I am back in classes for what should be my last year. It has taken me seven years to get to this point so you can imagine my excitement as well as my exhaustion. While most of my fellow nursing peers are just now beginning to experience their “senior-itis,” my senior-itis has been ongoing for the past three years. All that to say, despite the chaos of the last two weeks–school, new job, studying–I have made an effort to set aside little portions of each day to simply sit back and enjoy a moment of quiet solitude. Whether it’s 5 minutes or 15, I feel like these little moments go a long way to helping the rest of my day seem more manageable.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/09/silence-rejuvenation/peachbridalbouquet/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/09/peachbridalbouquet-575x431.jpg" alt="peachbridalbouquet" title="peachbridalbouquet" /></a></p>

<p>And since the farm is my typical way of relaxing–being out in nature, away from distractions and the daily grind–I decided to share this picture from a wedding Linda arranged yesterday. I think this peach bridal bouquet is stunning, simple, and ever so elegant.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/09/silence-rejuvenation/bug/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/09/bug-575x382.jpg" alt="leaf bug" title="bug" /></a></p>

<p>In the spirit of all things calm, simple and relaxing, I’ve also decided to share this picture of the lovely bug we found in our house a few weeks ago. Jack loved him and wanted some pictures so here is Freddie the leaf bug. I don’t know the technical name for these little guys, online everyone just calls them “leaf bugs” so if you know what else they are called, please fill us in.</p>

<p>Alrighty friends, I think that about does it for today. Coming soon I have 3 minutes brownies, soup recipes, a DIY wedding and our monthly shopping plan to save 50% on groceries (which worked!). Although I am unable to keep up three posts/week with classes back in session and more work hours, please keep checking back with us each week for new posts.</p>

    <p>Today was my last farm day for the year. I’m always sad when summer comes to an end but with Fall just around the corner the workload at the farm dwindles down and really, it’s just in time for me to head back to classes. After seven years and three degree changes I am finally beginning my last year. Hooray! Next week I will head back to class and will also be starting a new job. Such a busy month. I am so excited to get started with the year and finish up this chapter of my life but right now, feeling sad to say goodbye to summer and all the beauty to be found out on the farm.</p>

<p>Today Linda and I worked on a rather unique wedding. The bride wanted purple and orange–not a request we are used to getting, however, the bouquets were both fun and beautiful. The groom’s boutonniere was purple and the groomsmen had orange. Like many of us, the happy couple also enjoy a good tasting beer and thought it would be fun to include hops in their bouts. Once again, so fun!</p>

<p>I hope you’ve enjoyed these pictures and found a little bit of inspiration. I never would have thought to use purple and orange for wedding colors but after putting these together, I’m a believer! I so loved arranging this fun wedding and wish the happy couple all the best.</p>

    <p>I feel like I say this every week but yesterday’s farm flowers were <em>gorgeous</em>! Seriously. Kristin took eight buckets of flowers to a wedding in Virginia. You would think with eight buckets gone we wouldn’t have many left to work with but that was not the case. Instead, we (Linda and I) made a record amount of market bouquets–a grand total of 50 (trust me, that’s a lot).</p>

<p>Linda asked if I wanted to make an arrangement for the altar on Sunday and I, of course, jumped on board immediately. It was really hard to not make something beautiful with the array of flowers we had to work with.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/07/pink-burgundy-altar-arrangement/pinkburgundyaltararrangement-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/07/pinkburgundyaltararrangement-2.jpg" alt="pink &amp; burgundy altar arrangement" title="pink&amp;burgundyaltararrangement (2)" /></a></p>

<p>This pink and burgundy arrangement is my finished product and I must say, I love it! Pitcher arrangements like these are perfect for a country wedding or for simply taking to church on Sunday to share with others.</p>

<p>Here’s how this pitcher arrangement came to be:</p>

<p>First I started with the large limelight hydrangea. I cut them down to size and angled one toward each side of the pitcher and one smaller one a bit higher in the back to provide a “back” to the bouquet (a place where the eye will stop looking).</p>

<p>Next, I added several bunches of dark pink lisianthus buds. These pop against the creamy-white hydrangeas and serve as a great filler since the mouth of my pitcher is so wide.</p>

<p>Then I added two stems of lilies, one low and one higher, each angled a separate direction.I also added a pink and white gladiola semi-centered. The lisianthus serve as support for keeping the lilies and gladiola securely in place.</p>

<p>Finally I filled in the gaps. Down low I added trailing amaranthus (that’s the pretty burgundy spilling over the edge), I also added bits of white and green filler (poke weed, grasses), a couple green/cream lisianthus and hot pink dianthus.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/07/pink-burgundy-altar-arrangement/pinkburgundyaltararrangement-1/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/07/pinkburgundyaltararrangement-1.jpg" alt="pink &amp; burgundy altar arrangement" title="pink&amp;burgundyaltararrangement (1)" /></a></p>

<p>Arrangements like these are fairly simple to create if you stick to a specific order when combining your flowers–heavy bulky stems first, delicate flowers next supported by the larger flowers, then smaller pops of color, collar greenery and delicate accents.</p>

<p>I hope you’ve enjoyed this mini-flower-arrangement lesson. Try your own pitcher arrangement at home, all it takes is a few stems from your own backyard.</p>

    <p>Remember those beautiful brooches I mentioned in my <a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/07/bridal-brooch-bouquet-sneak-peek/">sneak peak bridal bouquet</a> post last week? Well, I have finally managed to pull all of that gorgeous jewelry together into one stunning bridal brooch bouquet.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/07/silver-gold-brooch-bouquet/bridalbroochbouquetantique/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/07/bridalbroochbouquetantique-575x382.jpg" alt="bridal brooch bouquet" title="bridalbroochbouquetantique" /></a></p>

<p>This being my first attempt at a brooch bouquet, I am quite pleased with the finished product. I cannot take all of the credit however, the lovely bride did an absolutely fantastic job of picking out all of the brooches for her bouquet. At first, I wasn’t sure how it was all going to come together as she had a wide array of metals and gemstones included in the mix, but her creative instincts paid off and the jewelry came together beautifully.</p>

<p>The hardest part of this bouquet (which I didn’t have to do) would definitely be the wiring of the brooches. In order to make one of these bouquets you need to take floral wire or some other sturdy wire and loop it around the clasps on each individual brooch. The tricky part is wiring the brooches well enough that they will remain upright and sturdy. The more time you take to wire the brooches carefully, the easier it will be to assemble your bouquet. You may also want to use hot glue underneath the brooch where you attach the wire to help secure the wire more sturdily to the clasp.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/07/silver-gold-brooch-bouquet/bridalbroochbouquet-1-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/07/bridalbroochbouquet-1-575x382.jpg" alt="" title="bridalbroochbouquet (1)" /></a></p>

<p>Take three strong hydrangeas. We used fake ones which I highly recommend if you are making a full bouquet like the one pictured. This bouquet is very heavy so you will need the heavy weight of fake flowers to support all of the brooches. If you prefer a bouquet with intermittent brooches, you can use live hydrangea and add other live flowers into the mix to help fill holes and support the jewelry.</p>

<p>Cut your fake hydrangea stems the length that you want your bouquet to be. I use a large mason jar as my guide, placing the flowers inside you want the bottom edge of the flowers to rest gently on the top edge of the jar (or whatever vase you will use at the reception).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/07/bridal-brooch-bouquet-sneak-peek/broochbouquetcg-1/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/07/broochbouquetcg-1-575x472.jpg" alt="brooch bouquet" title="broochbouquet" /></a></p>

<p>Wrap your hydrangea stems together with floral tape (no need to wrap all the way down, just secure them together).</p>

<p>Now comes the fun part. Poke each of your wired brooches through the tops of the hydrangea petals until they rest gently on top of your flowers. Continue to add brooches one by one until you have covered the tops and sides of your hydrangeas.</p>

<p>Once all the brooches are in place, carefully wrap all wire stems together using floral tape. At this point, the bouquet is very heavy so you may want to ask a friend to hold it as you wrap.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/07/silver-gold-brooch-bouquet/bridalbroochbraid/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/07/bridalbroochbraid-575x382.jpg" alt="bridalbroochbraid" title="bridalbroochbraid" /></a></p>

<p>Once the stems are wrapped all the way to the bottom. Grab your ribbon and cover the floral tape with whichever ribbon wrap style you prefer. I will post a tutorial for the classic braid shown in these pictures next Friday.</p>

<p>I hope you’ve found these instructions helpful. As always let me know if you have any questions or if I need to clarify any steps.</p>

    <p>I am constantly writing to you about buying flowers locally and arranging them yourself for special events or weddings but what about those specialty pieces like corsages and boutonnieres? Can you also make these yourself? The answer is “yes &amp; yes” and I’m ready to show you how.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/07/how-to-boutonniere/bluegrayboutonniere-6/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/07/bluegrayboutonniere-6-575x382.jpg" alt="blue gray boutonniere how to" title="bluegrayboutonniere (6)" /></a></p>

<p>This little boutonniere is incredibly simple to make and uses items that are hardy enough to remain upright even when out of water overnight. When we make boutonnieres for weddings on the farm, they are usually assembled the afternoon prior to the wedding, at the same time we arrange centerpieces and bouquets. If you know what to use, this is not too far ahead of the event to assemble the boutonniere. Once you have finished assembling all your bouts, simply store in the refrigerator until the big event.</p>

<p>When choosing stems for your bout, be sure to choose ones that are hardy. This bout uses Ivy as the backing, dusty miller, blue thistle, dianthus and a small succulent.</p>

<p><em>Assembly:</em></p>

<p>Step 1: Find a flat surface and lay out one leaf of Ivy. Lay one leaf of Dusty Miller on top.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/07/how-to-boutonniere/bluegrayboutonniere-8/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/07/bluegrayboutonniere-8-575x411.jpg" alt="" title="bluegrayboutonniere (8)" /></a></p>

<p>Step 2: Now add a small piece of blue thistle on top of the Dusty Miller and slightly left of center.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/07/how-to-boutonniere/bluegrayboutonniere-1/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/07/bluegrayboutonniere-1-575x410.jpg" alt="blue gray boutonniere how to" title="bluegrayboutonniere (1)" /></a></p>

<p>Step 3: Lay the Dianthus to the right of the thistle.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/07/how-to-boutonniere/bluegrayboutonniere-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/07/bluegrayboutonniere-2-575x411.jpg" alt="blue gray boutonniere how to" title="bluegrayboutonniere (2)" /></a></p>

<p>Step 4: Push the succulent up under the Dianthus and slightly to the right of center. You should position the succulent so that it is sort of supporting the Dianthus, that way, even if it decides to wilt it will be supported and go unnoticed.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/07/how-to-boutonniere/bluegrayboutonniere-3/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/07/bluegrayboutonniere-3-575x411.jpg" alt="blue gray boutonniere how to" title="bluegrayboutonniere (3)" /></a></p>

<p>Step 5: Now you want to add a smaller Ivy leaf to the front of the bout, right underneath the succulent giving it a sort of clam-like appearance (sorry I forgot this picture, but look at the finished product up top and you will see what I mean).</p>

<p>Step 6: Pinch the stems together right underneath the heads of the stems and cut the stems and varying lengths. This is helpful for those of you who want to cover the stems with ribbon, it makes a gradual thickening as you up the stems toward the flowers.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/07/how-to-boutonniere/bluegrayboutonniere-4/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/07/bluegrayboutonniere-4-575x382.jpg" alt="blue gray boutonniere how to" title="bluegrayboutonniere (4)" /></a></p>

<p>Step 7: While holding the stems tightly with one hand, grab your roll of florist tape and begin to wrap the stems at the neck of the bout. If you just want a simple bout without ribbon, continue to wrap the stems all the way down with the florist tape (ribbon wrap tutorial to come).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/07/how-to-boutonniere/bluegrayboutonniere-5/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/07/bluegrayboutonniere-5-575x410.jpg" alt="blue gray boutonniere how to" title="bluegrayboutonniere (5)" /></a></p>

<p>There you have it, one <em>very</em> simple boutonniere crash course. Don’t forget to be creative with your materials–there are an endless possibilities when making your bout. One of my all-time favorite items to use is dried wheat or barley for a vintage look.</p>

    <p>For this week’s Friday at the Farm, we had our first bridal luncheon of the summer. In fact, the only bridal luncheon on the books this year. For those of you who are unfamiliar with this event, Linda gives our brides the option of having a bridal luncheon the day before their wedding. This luncheon allows the bride and bridesmaids to relax on the farm for a couple of hours and basically play with flowers. Sounds nice, right?!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/06/sweet-pink-bouquet-herbs/pinkbridesmaidbouquet-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/06/pinkbridesmaidbouquet-2-575x382.jpg" alt="pink bridesmaid bouquet" title="pinkbridesmaidbouquet (2)" /></a></p>

<p>We teach the ladies how to arrange their bouquets for the big day and, of course, help them as needed. Some brides and bridesmaids are quick to catch on to the techniques involved in hand-held-bouquet-making, others prefer to have us shape the bulk of their arrangement–either way, the bridal luncheons are fun for all.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/06/sweet-pink-bouquet-herbs/pinkbridesmaidbouquet-4/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/06/pinkbridesmaidbouquet-4.jpg" alt="pink bridesmaid bouquet" title="pinkbridesmaidbouquet (4)" /></a></p>

<p>Linda and I also arranged market bouquets following the luncheon festivities. Here is one of my favorite arrangements from the day. I also found a fantastic new picture spot on the farm–love this lighting.</p>

<p><em>Arrangement:</em> sweet peas, decorative sage, dianthus, mountain mint (smells SO good), oregano, goose neck</p>

    <p>Today was another glorious Friday out at <a href="http://www.auntwillieswildflowers.com">Aunt Willie’s Wildflowers</a>. With no weddings on the books this weekend, we were able to devote ourselves fully to the task of arranging bucket upon bucket of market bouquets for the Kingsport Farmer’s Market. Linda’s customers will be SO happy.</p>

<p>Beautiful flowers to work with, beautiful weather to work in, beautiful scenery surrounding our work space, all in all a fantastic way to end the week. Here are a few photos of the flowers we had to work with this week.</p>

    <p>This past week, the flower farm crew learned to stretch our imaginations a little bit farther than usual. This was the first time we were asked to arrange two weddings on the same day, and to make it a bit more interesting…two vastly different color palettes and settings.</p>

<p><em>Wedding #1:</em> flowy, wild &amp; bright; different flowers for each bouquet, outdoor wedding<br />
Flowers: grasses, mint, sunflowers, larkspur, black-eyed susans, lilies, bells of ireland, feverfew, campanula, and more.</p>

<p><em>Wedding #2:</em> neat, rounded bouquets, specific color pallet: periwinkle and raspberry, continuity across bouquets&amp; arrangements<br />
Flowers: blue, white and pink hydrangea (we even spray-painted a few–yes, this is an option), hot pink roses, snapdragons, holly, feverfew</p>

<p>We also made a grand total of 23 boutonnieres this week (trust me, that’s a lot).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/06/wedding-flower-girl-headband/flowergirlheadband/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/06/flowergirlheadband-325x419.jpg" alt="Flower Girl Headband Bright Colors" title="flowergirlheadband" /></a></p>

<p>Although vastly different in flowers and setting, both weddings were quite beautiful. My absolute favorite part of arranging these weddings, however, was the flower girl headbands. And, of course, I never took a finished photo of the pieces (grr). However, if you will excuse the sad, unfinished photos I can show you the headbands minus the ribbon.</p>

<p>I picked up these plastic headbands with a thin layer of foam on top in Walmart’s craft section for $1.17. To attach the flowers, I simply arranged two small grouping of flowers and greens in my hand and wrapped the stems with florist tape, as you would a boutonniere.</p>

<p>Next, I placed the larger grouping higher on the side of the headband, stem-ends facing down (toward your ear) and attached it to the headband by wrapping the stems to the band with florist tape. Then I took the smaller grouping and attached it to the band with stems facing up (toward the top of your head) and sort-of wedged under the flowers of the first grouping. So, the two flower bunches are facing each other (you can see the shape we are going for in the photo of Kristin’s yellow headband).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/06/wedding-flower-girl-headband/flowergirlheadband-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/06/flowergirlheadband1-325x216.jpg" alt="Flower Girl headband muted colors" title="flowergirlheadband" /></a></p>

<p>The last step, not shown here, is to wrap the ribbon of your choosing around the rest of the head band. I made a small knot under the edge of the flowers on each side (so it can’t be seen) and continued to wrap down toward the ends of the headband where I tied off the ribbon with another small knot.</p>

<p>I know that sounds a bit confusing but once you start the process, it comes pretty naturally. The brightly-colored headband is the one I made, the muted yellow one was made by my good friend Kristin who keeps me sane on those days I can’t seem to find a rhythm to my arranging. Don’t we all need one of those friends? I hope this has been an enjoyable read for you. Best of luck!</p>

    <p>Hello friends, Jack and I just got back from a mini-vacation to see the family–at least some of them. So, to make up for missing Floral Friday, here is a little post on a beautiful and bold wedding arrangement made for a bright wedding two weeks ago.</p>

<p>Seriously, isn’t this arrangement gorgeous?!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/06/bold-bright-wedding-arrangement/brightweddingflowers-1/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/06/brightweddingflowers-1-325x488.jpg" alt="Bright Wedding Flower Arrangement" title="brightweddingflowers (1)" /></a></p>

<p>I can’t get over how simple and breathtaking these flowers are, and so simple. Some of my favorite flowers are the ones that grow in mixed colors, you see this effect with flowers like Dahlias, which no one can deny they are beautiful. However, there is something about the pure colors–especially pure and bold like this arrangement.</p>

<p>This arrangement began in a pastel-colored pitcher but we discovered white was the only way to go. The flowers are gorgeous on their own and a colored pitcher didn’t make as big of a statement. Here’s another picture for you.</p>

<p><em>Stems:</em></p>

<p>Pink Peonies<br />
Magenta Snapdragons<br />
White Snapdragons<br />
Blue Delphinium<br />
Sunflowers<br />
Hosta Leaves<br />
Bells of Ireland<br />
Ornamental Grasses</p>

<p><em>Arrangement:</em></p>

<p>This arrangement starts out a bit different from what I normally recommend. There is not much filler used so I would start with your tall stems that are used most, in this case the snapdragons. Next, add in the little bit of filler–Bells of Ireland (the green things that look like bells–just in case you needed help with that).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/06/bold-bright-wedding-arrangement/brightweddingflowers-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/06/brightweddingflowers-2-575x382.jpg" alt="Bright Wedding Flower Arrangement" title="brightweddingflowers (2)" /></a></p>

<p>Now we need to focus on pulling the eye downward. Start by placing pink peonies low in the arrangement, nearly to the vase rim. The sunflowers have large stems so I would cut those lower than the snaps but higher than the peonies. Make sure you don’t cut them all the exact same height, you want these to be varied throughout the middle third of the arrangement height. Add these next since they will fill large holes and take up much of the vase space.</p>

<p>Now you can add the delicate-stemmed delphinium for beautiful pops of bluish-purple color. Finally add the Hosta leaves around the rim of the vase, as if cradling the peonies. Hosta leaves give the eye an end point for the arrangement.</p>

    <p>A few weeks ago I had the privilege of helping Linda with flower arrangements for a vintage wedding. If you haven’t figured it out before, it seems the go-to flower for vintage is the beautiful peony. And really, who would argue with that choice? The peony is absolutely exquisite in all colors but this coral color is by far my favorite. I could look at it for hours. Really? Not even kidding.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/05/coral-peony-bridal-bouquet/antiquewedding-3/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/05/antiquewedding-3-575x382.jpg" alt="" title="antiquewedding (3)" /></a></p>

<p>Here’s another look, in case you too, can’t stop staring.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/05/coral-peony-bridal-bouquet/antiquewedding-2-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/05/antiquewedding-2-575x382.jpg" alt="" title="antiquewedding (2)" /></a></p>

<p>Alrighty then, tearing eyes away, closing mouth, moving on…</p>

<p>The bridal bouquet was made mainly with white and coral peonies, white stock, yellow, white &amp; peach ranunculus, chartreuse-colored physocarpis, and bells of Ireland.</p>

<p>Bouquets are different than arrangements in styling order. With arrangements you typically want to start by placing your filler since that will take up more of the vase space. With bouquets however, filler is much more scarce so you actually begin with your flowers, and usually the bulkier flowers first to provide support to the smaller stems.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/05/coral-peony-bridal-bouquet/antiquewedding-5/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/05/antiquewedding-5-575x382.jpg" alt="" title="antiquewedding (5)" /></a></p>

<p>So, can you guess which flower we start with here? That’s right, the peonies! Group a few peonies in the middle, then add a white stock in between each peony. Then add a few Bells of Ireland stems around the edges of the peonies and stocks, follow with an outer layer of peonies in the open spaces.</p>

<p>As you move toward the outer edges of your bouquet, make sure you are continuing to push the outer edges upward instead of letting them fall low. With bridal and bridesmaid bouquets you want to see all of the flowers at the top, not lose them down underneath at the spot where you would hold the bouquet, make sense?</p>

<p>Alright, now all that’s left is filling in the spaces and adding a few pops of color and filler. This bouquet has Phisocarpus leaves placed sporadically throughout for a bit of added filler and little peach, white, and yellow Ranunculus for added color. Hold the bouquet lower on the stems as you add flowers. This allows the bouquet to sit loosely giving you plenty of wiggle room for adding stems in last minute or even pulling a few out.</p>

<p>And of course, if you like the look, add Hosta leaves around the very bottom to create a collar. This gives the eye an end point and keeps the focus on the flowers above the collar instead of trailing off into nothingness.</p>

    <p><em>Occasion:</em> Baby Shower with Unknown Baby Gender</p>

<p>Use this bouquet as inspiration for a baby shower with an unknown baby gender.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/?attachment_id=3990"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/05/DSC_0154-575x381.jpg" alt="" title="DSC_0154" /></a></p>

<p><em>Stems:</em></p>

<p>pink/burgundy dianthus<br />
burgundy ranunculi<br />
yellow ranunculi<br />
yellow stock<br />
blue baptisia</p>

<p><em>Arranging:</em></p>

<p>Begin with the dianthus as they are both sturdy and full so they will take up much of the empty space allowing you to strategically place the more delicate stems.</p>

<p>Next, add your contrasting colors, I put in two stems of yellow stock, one for height and color and a second to make the bouquet even. Accent the stock with yellow ranunculi spread throughout the arrangement in lower areas.</p>

<p>Fill any holes with the burgundy ranunculi. Pairing different flowers of similar colors in one bouquet gives the arrangement texture and dimension. Finally, add the tall stem(s) of baptisia. More stems of baptisia will give you a more obvious boy/girl theme or you can find another bluish flower to add to the mix like ageratum.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/05/baby-shower-flowers-painted-jars/paintedballjar-3/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/05/paintedballjar-3-575x382.jpg" alt="paintedballjar" title="paintedballjar (3)" /></a></p>

<p><em>Centerpiece:</em></p>

<p>Take four ball jars (or a variety of used jars from your pantry) and paint the inside of each with a different pastel shade: yellow, blue, pink, green, etc. If you don’t have any pastel paints on hand, just mix each color with white until you reach the desired shade.</p>

<p>The first coat does a good job of filling in all white/clear space on the jar, however, if placed in the light it shows the stroke lines of your brush. I tried using a normal painter’s brush as well as one of those Styrofoam tipped brushes, but the regular brush worked much better. Wait 20 minutes for the first coat to dry before painting a second coat that hides the original brush strokes.</p>

<p>Make arrangements to place in your painted jars from the flowers listed above. Add three hosta leaves around the jar rims to form a collar. Group the jars in the center of the table for a beautiful bold centerpiece.</p>

<p>Painting the jars took about 30 minutes total so don’t be deterred by the extra effort of painting clear jars instead of buying colored vases/jars. Trust me, the extra time is well worth your efforts and will not go unnoticed.</p>

    <p>We all have those favorite flowers, you know the ones you wait anxiously for all year and then it seems as soon as they bloom they wilt away once more. For me, the gorgeous peony is the flower I most look forward to at the beginning of the flower season. Unfortunately, it seems these flowers are gone before I can be out on the farm enjoying their beauty.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/05/how-to-preserve-peonies/farmflowers-40/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/05/farmflowers-40-575x382.jpg" alt="peonies" title="farmflowers (40)" /></a></p>

<p>Linda, however, has taught me a few tricks for making peonies last. The peony is a popular flower for weddings so every year we make these beauties last a bit longer by cutting them early and letting them hibernate in the fridge for a few weeks.</p>

<p>For those of you who want to save your peonies for a big event or simply want to keep them around longer to brighten up your home, you can follow these simple steps to preserving peonies.<br />
_<br />
How to Preserve Peonies:_</p>

<p>1.) Cut peonies when they are in the “marshmallow” stage. Squeeze the bud and if it feels like a marshmallow, they are ready to cut and store. The image below is just before marshmallow stage.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/farm-photos/farmflowers-33-copy/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/05/farmflowers-33-Copy-575x382.jpg" alt="" title="farmflowers (33) - Copy" /></a></p>

<p>2.) Next, place a bunch of peony stems in double-layered newspaper. The image below <em>is</em> marshmallow stage.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/05/how-to-preserve-peonies/farmflowers-42/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/05/farmflowers-42-575x382.jpg" alt="" title="farmflowers (42)" /></a></p>

<p>3.) Wrap the newspaper around the stems.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/05/how-to-preserve-peonies/farmflowers-43/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/05/farmflowers-43-575x410.jpg" alt="" title="farmflowers (43)" /></a></p>

<p>4.) Place in a refrigerator to hibernate up to 1 month.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/05/how-to-preserve-peonies/farmflowers-44/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/05/farmflowers-44-575x382.jpg" alt="" title="farmflowers (44)" /></a></p>

<p>When you pull the peonies out again, they will look slightly less perfect than when you put them in but just place them in water and in a few hours they will start to open up. The only downside to preserving peonies is that their shelf-life post-refrigeration is less than if they were freshly cut–about two days.</p>

<p>Let us know if you have any questions!</p>

<p>There are a few basic methods to arranging flowers. For an arrangement like the one shown above, it is best to start with your bulky flowers (the white lilacs) as those take up a lot of space and make filling in the rest of the arrangement fairly simple. Place 3-5 stems of lilacs of varying heights in your container–the number of stems depends on their size and the size of your container. Angle each stem in a different direction (or if they are smaller you can try grouping).</p>

<p>With an arrangement this size I would next fill in with greenery to add support and stability to your lilacs, also providing a sturdy base for the more delicate flowers. The greenery in this arrangement is simply the drooping foliage from a lilac bush on the farm. Make sure you add greenery both around the lip of the container, giving it the spillover effect, as well as tall and short stems in and around the lilacs to add dimension.</p>

<p>Next, add your color. This is usually a more delicate stem, so be sure to place gently and secure well amid the greenery. Linda used tulips for her color.</p>

<p>Finally, in order to really make the tulips stand out, Linda added a chartreuse color of greenery to the mix. Chartreuse greenery is one of my all-time favorite items to add to arrangements. Although dark greenery is pretty, it is still dark, making your one bright color a big leap from the dark green. The chartreuse color bridges this dark-light gap and allows the brightness of the flower to pop while keeping the overall arrangement in balance. The chartreuse-colored stem in this arrangement is physocarpus.</p>

<p>The wonderful thing about this arrangement is most people with a garden have these flowers. The flowers are not anything out of the ordinary and you can substitute the greenery with just about any shrub or decorative grass in your own backyard.</p>

<p>I hope you’ve enjoyed these quick and simple steps to building a beautiful flower arrangement for your home. Happy arranging!</p>

    <p>Today was another Bird’s Nest workshop out at <a href="http://www.auntwillieswildflowers.com">Aunt Willie’s Wildlflowers</a>. These are just a few of the photos from the day. We ate a delicious pasta salad, rolls, and strawberry almond salad. So healthy!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/03/bird-nest-workshop/birds-nest-ws-20121-001/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/03/Birds-Nest-WS-20121-001-575x359.jpg" alt="" title="Bird's Nest WS 2012-3" /></a></p>

<p>Everything on the farm is blooming early thanks to our mild winter so there are more flowers than usual right now. This is wonderful for viewing, not so great for the upcoming wedding season. I suppose we can’t complain too much with all these beauties.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/03/bird-nest-workshop/birds-nest-ws-2012/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/03/Birds-Nest-WS-2012-575x359.jpg" alt="" title="Bird's Nest WS 2012" /></a></p>

<p>These handcrafted bird’s nest are the perfect table decoration for your upcoming Easter get-together. Check out how to make one for yourself and be sure to view more photos from the day over on our <a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/farm-photos/">“Farm Photos”</a> tab.</p>

<p><em>Supplies:</em></p>

<p>1 small straw wreath<br />
1 cardboard circle that matches the wreath size<br />
1 spool of paddle wire<br />
1 small bag of fake moss<br />
1 bag of two-pronged pins<br />
moss, nuts, dried flowers, lichen, and any other decoration from nature you can think of</p>

<p><em>Instructions:</em></p>

<p>1. Take your fake moss and cover the straw wreath, wrapping it loosely with paddle wire as you move around the wreath. Twist the paddle wire together once the entire wreath is covered. You really just need to make sure no straw is showing on the sides because the real moss will cover the top of the wreath.<br />
2. Using hot glue, attach the cardboard circle to the bottom of your wreath. This will keep your moss and pretties from falling through.<br />
3. Take various colors and textures of moss and fill the wreath hole and various parts of the top of your wreath. You can use as much or as little moss as you’d like for this part. One of our farm ladies today covered her entire wreath in moss and other just had little trails of moss coming out of the center and over the edges.<br />
4. Now use dried hydrangea, daffodils, dogwood, nuts, lichen, twigs, wheat, grasses and anything else you can find to decorate the rim of your nest. This year, I used blue hydrangea bunches on each side, pussy willow branches, feathers, dried pods, larkspur, and artemisia to decorate.<br />
5. Once all your decor is secured in place with pins or hot glue, drop in a few candy eggs and your bird’s nest is complete!</p>

    <p>Working on a cut-flower farm is not the idealized job I once thought it to be. No, I used to think cutting flowers all day would be simple, relaxing, and inspiring. Although at times cutting can be all of these things, more often working on the farm can be summed up as painful, dirty, and sweaty. Let me assure you, the cut-flower life is not one to be entered into lightly. Although aspects are very rewarding it is a difficult job–and this from someone who only works on the farm once a week.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/03/springs-sprouts/dsc_0059-001/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/03/DSC_0059-001-575x381.jpg" alt="" title="Farm Sunset" /></a></p>

<p>I spent a few days this week, my spring break, helping Linda out at <a href="www.auntwillieswildflowers.com">Aunt Willies Wildflowers</a>. What do I have to show for my hard work? Sunburns, callouses, 50-or-so cuts and scrapes (and no, I am in <em>no way</em> complaining) and of course a few photos just for you. For me, the hard work and painfully sore nights are worth being outside and enjoying the daily surprises of nature.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/03/springs-sprouts/dsc_0017/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/03/DSC_0017-575x381.jpg" alt="" title="DSC_0017" /></a></p>

<p>In the early months of spring, we (and I mean mostly Roy and Linda) take on a variety of tasks to prepare for the cutting season. These tasks include the following:<br />
-fill seed trays (each holding upwards of 200 seedlings at a time)<br />
-hoe flower beds<br />
-stake down landscape fabric<br />
-transplant seedlings into the hoophouse<br />
-clear dead bushes and plants<br />
-weed for hours on end.<br />
Getting the farm ready for the cutting season is a very dirty job, but of course, someone has to do it.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/03/springs-sprouts/dsc_0022-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/03/DSC_0022-575x381.jpg" alt="" title="DSC_0022" /></a></p>

<p>I took these photos to give you an idea of how barren the farm can seem early in the season and how incredibly fast the plants grow to fill all this empty space (check out last year’s images under <a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/farm-photos/">“Farm Photos”</a> to get an idea). It never ceases to amaze me how many new plants are sprouting each week.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/03/springs-sprouts/dsc_0069-001/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/03/DSC_0069-001-575x381.jpg" alt="" title="Sprouts" /></a></p>

<p>One month from now these empty beds will be full of flowers so hang on to your britches and keep checking back with us because them cuttin’ days are coming.</p>

    <p>I’ve realized over the past year that I am much better at capturing the small details of our farm workshops than I am at photographing the people involved. Perhaps it’s because the objects don’t move, or maybe it has to do with their vivid colors. Either way, I thought I would share a few of my favorite photos from last week’s cooking lesson and moss workshop.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/02/setting-the-scene/dsc_0044/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/02/DSC_0044-575x381.jpg" alt="" title="DSC_0044" /></a></p>

<p>These photos capture unique aspects of the atmosphere we try to create out at <a href="http://www.auntwillieswildflowers.com">Aunt Willie’s Wildflowers</a>–quaint, old-fashioned, peaceful–although nature has already done most of the work for us. Whatever words these might bring to mind, I hope they make you take pause and think about the little details in your own life that you may be overlooking every day.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/02/setting-the-scene/dsc_0068/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/02/DSC_0068-575x381.jpg" alt="" title="DSC_0068" /></a></p>

<p>When planning a dinner party, birthday, or wedding, don’t forget the impact little details have on the event and on the way you remember it years later.</p>

    <p>This Saturday was our first workshop of the season at <a href="http://www.auntwillieswildflowers.com">Aunt Willies Wildflowers</a>. You may wonder what type of flowers are growing in Tennessee in the middle of February? Well, with the exception of a few flowers that have sprouted in the hoop house and early-bird daffodils, we have lots and lots of moss.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/02/moss-workshop/dsc_0112/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/02/DSC_0112-575x381.jpg" alt="" title="DSC_0112" /></a></p>

<p>Moss is an easily underestimated little plant, however the possibilities are endless. For the workshop we filled frosted glassware with dirt then the ladies took mosses of varied colors and textures to cover the dirt. Finally, the ladies used a variety of twigs, dried plants, pebbles, and willow to make their moss gardens come to life.</p>

<p>This workshop also included a home-cooked meal along with cooking lesson from <a href="http://www.lizbushong.com/index.html">Liz Bushong of Serve it up Sassy!</a> She made a mullet soup, spring green salad with blood orange dressing, and lemon-herb scones.<br />
<a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/02/moss-workshop/dsc_0039/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/02/DSC_0039-325x215.jpg" alt="" title="DSC_0039" /></a></p>

<p>I also made a another batch of lemon white chocolate truffles to share. You can find the recipe <a href="http://kellynbakes.blogspot.com/2010/05/white-chocolate-lemon-truffles.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>Here are my recipe adjustments: I used 1-1/2 c. of white chocolate, and instead of using the double boiler method I combined the zest of 1 lemon with the cream and butter in a saucepan over medium heat until it started bubbling. Then I removed the pan from heat, added the chocolate and mixed until smooth. Next add the extract and transfer to a bowl to cool in the fridge. Follow the rest of the directions at <a href="http://kellynbakes.blogspot.com/2010/05/white-chocolate-lemon-truffles.html">K Bake</a>s accordingly.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/farm-photos/dsc_0162/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/06/DSC_0162-325x489.jpg" alt="" title="Tea Kettle and Pussy Willow" /></a>After completing the moss gardens, the ladies used various willow, forced forsythia and privet berries to make winter arrangements. Even in the winter, with no flowers in bloom, it is still possible to make beautiful arrangements for your home.</p>

<p>The moss workshop/cooking class was a new addition to the farm schedule and a good start to the flower season. I’ve added a few more <em>edited</em> photos of the workshop under our <a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/farm-photos/">“Farm Photos”</a> tab, complete with photos of Linda’s beautiful table setting, moss gardens, and flower arrangements from the hoop house. To see all the <em>rough</em> workshop photos <a href="http://www.dropbox.com/gallery/38095343/1/Moss%20Workshop?h=cd2b86">click here</a>.</p>

<p>Make your own wooded arrangement or moss garden this week–you might be surprised to find that everything you need is right outside your front door.</p>

    <p>When I first started working out at Aunt Willie’s Wildflowers, I assumed that the end of summer meant the end of workshops and pretty arrangements, luckily, I was mistaken. As if the pumpkin workshop wasn’t cool enough, come December, Linda holds a Christmas centerpiece workshop. The Christmas centerpieces are always beautiful with a variety of styles.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/12/christmas-at-the-farm/centerpieces-039-1/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/12/centerpieces-039-1-575x381.jpg" alt="" title="centerpieces 039-1" /></a></p>

<p>The centerpiece above is my attempt this year. I really like the touches of gold throughout it. Since we are heading home in 2 days (yay!), I decided not to waste my centerpiece on our empty home and gifted it to one of my favorite professors. I know, what a suck-up.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/12/christmas-at-the-farm/centerpieces-040-1/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/12/centerpieces-040-1-325x489.jpg" alt="" title="centerpieces 040-1" /></a>These centerpieces are very simple to make, all you need is a tray, a block of oasis, and lots of greenery. We soaked the oasis in water, cut it to fit the trays (if necessary), and started assembling.</p>

<p>Here are a few of the basics to assembling an oasis centerpiece:</p>

<p>Choose one type of greenery for your first row, my first one was pine, insert ends into the oasis at an angle. You want to cut all your greenery (for all three rows) 8-10 inches long, and space 1-2 inches apart. Row #2 will be up 1-2 inches and will align with the spaces so you won’t have gaps.</p>

<p>Depending on how full your branches are, each row should use about 12 branches total (that’s 4 on each side and 2 on the ends if your centerpiece is the size of a whole block of oasis).</p>

<p>Pick a different greenery for your second layer, I used cedar, and start going around the oasis 1-2 inches up from the first row. Follow the same principles as the first. Pick a third greenery for your top row (this is the top of your sides, not the top of your oasis).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/12/christmas-at-the-farm/centerpieces-036-1-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/12/centerpieces-036-11-325x305.jpg" alt="" title="centerpieces 036-1" /></a></p>

<p>Once the sides are covered, choose a more decorative greenery to start covering the top of your oasis, angling the outer branch slightly upward. I used brown tipped cedar, try to use a more decorative type of branch because this layer will be more visible.</p>

<p>Use any other greenery/shrub/leaf to fill in the top and any holes you may have. I like to go back and place a few magnolia leaves in various places throughout the layers–the shine make the centerpiece look fancy and helps the textures stand out. This is also when I went back through and added bits of yellow.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/12/christmas-at-the-farm/centerpieces-011-1/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/12/centerpieces-011-1-325x308.jpg" alt="" title="centerpieces 011-1" /></a></p>

<p>Now it’s time to add other decorative elements to the top of your centerpiece–dried fruit slices, whole apples, hydrangea, nuts, pine cones, candles. You can use pins, mini-stakes, or hot glue to hold everything in place. I used holly branches, a few slices of dried limes, and Queen Anne’s Lace.</p>

<p>Remember to branch out and stretch your creative capacities. The decorating options with these centerpieces are limitless so take your time and enjoy showing off the final product to friends and family throughout the holiday season.</p>

    <p>Tuesday evening was the night you’ve all been waiting for…the pumpkin workshop. I think I say this every time but, this workshop just might be my absolute favorite. The pumpkin workshop brings a little sophistication to the traditional idea of carving pumpkins for the fall.</p>

<p>I went straight to the workshop from class so these photos are courtesy of Linda. Thank you Linda!</p>

<p>The pumpkin below was the demo pumpkin I made for the group.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/09/flower-pumpkin-workshop/dsc_0692/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/09/DSC_0692-325x479.jpg" alt="" title="Tiffany's Pumpkin" /></a></p>

<p>Would you like to make your very own flower pumpkin? Here’s what you need and a few pointers to get you started:</p>

<p><strong>Tools:</strong></p>

<p>1 pumpkin (any size)<br />
1 plastic cup (like the coca cola ones from McDonalds, the height depends on how big your pumpkin is)<br />
Flowers<br />
1 block of oasis</p>

<p>**Directions:<br />
**<br />
1. Soak a block of oasis in water.<br />
2. Trace the rim of your cup on top of the pumpkin. Cut along the traced line.<br />
3. Hollow out the inside of your pumpkin.<br />
4. Cut oasis edges so it fits snugly into your plastic cup, leave the oasis slightly higher than the cup’s rim.<br />
5. Insert cup into the pumpkin and add water to the cup.<br />
6. Insert flower stems into the oasis as you shape your arrangement.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/09/flower-pumpkin-workshop/dsc_0688/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/09/DSC_0688-325x489.jpg" alt="" title="DSC_0688" /></a> (Below: Kristin’s Pumpkin)</p>

<p>Now comes the fun part, the flowers! Don’t let a lack of flowers deter you from attempting this project. You can use pretty much anything to fill your pumpkin, leaves, grasses, bushes, dried flowers, fresh flowers, weeds, etc.</p>

<p>Start with a plant that will drape the top of your pumpkin, so the rim of the cup and oasis do not show. I chose peppers and weeds with berries because they are heavy enough to drape down over the pumpkin.</p>

<p>Next, choose 1 or 2 fillers to give some weight to the base of the arrangement and fill in the larger spaces. I used bunches of goldenrod and a few branches of leaves with a different texture than the leaves towards the bottom of the pumpkin.</p>

<p>Now, choose a few staple flowers to draw the eye. You want your main flowers to stay fairly low to the pumpkin, anchoring the arrangement (notice the height of my pink dahlia and Kristin’s red dahlia).</p>

<p>After that, I basically just add extra ornamentals of varying heights for finishing touches. There are blue berry-like pods (castor bean), cattails, and some longer stems of goldenrod for height.</p>

And, just to prove that you can put together a spectacular looking pumpkin with a variety of plants, here are just a few of the pumpkins from Tuesday’s crew.</p>

<p>They were all so wonderful but I can only fit so many pictures into my post. Be sure to let the ladies know how wonderful their pumpkins look and if you put together a pumpkin of your own, send us a picture!</p>

    <p>Yesterday at the farm we had a Mother’s Day workshop which is one of my absolute favorite workshops each year. Mother’s day falls at the best time of the year for Linda’s flowers. The flowers are incredibly fragrant and absolutely gorgeous.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/05/flowers-for-mom/garden-pasta-farm-043-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/05/garden-pasta-farm-043-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="garden, pasta, farm 043" /></a></p>

<p>Some of my all-time favorites that bloom around this time include: ranunculus (the rose-like flower above), baptisia (the yellow stalk-like flower above), peonies, mock orange (my favorite), rhododendrons, spirea, smoke bush, and much more.</p>

<p>So, in honor of Mother’s Day, (and because pictures of the farm are my mother’s favorite posts) I decided to post some pictures of the beautiful flowers that all you mothers deserve to be given.</p>

<p>Happy Mother’s Day!</p>

    <p>Happy Easter! Seeing as we are so far away from home, Linda Doan, <a href="http://auntwillieswildflowers.com/" title="Aunt Willie's Wildflowers">Aunt Willies Wildflowers</a>, invited Jack and I to join in their Sunday afternoon celebrations.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/04/i-flung-the-tongue/easter-090/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/04/easter-090-575x408.jpg" alt="" title="easter 090" /></a></p>

<p>The Doans have become quite famous in our little neck of the woods for a variety of reasons. Linda taught at Milligan as the health and fitness professor, Roy (her hubby), retired from teaching mathematics at a local school. They own a farm, raise and sell cattle, grow and sell cut flowers, and volunteer their time and home every week.</p>

<p>However, what the Doans are perhaps most famous for is their much anticipated cow-tongue flinging.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/04/i-flung-the-tongue/easter-092/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/04/easter-092-325x433.jpg" alt="" title="easter 092" /></a></p>

<p>Yes, that’s right, today we flung the tongue.</p>

<p>Since Roy raises grass-fed beef, there are apparently a vast supply of cow tongues each year that the Doans are able to freeze and then thaw for various occasions.</p>

<p>The game concept is simple, throw or toss the tongue into a watering trough, moving farther back with each fling. If you miss, you’re out. Linda was today’s champ.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/04/i-flung-the-tongue/easter-076/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/04/easter-076-325x433.jpg" alt="" title="easter 076" /></a></p>

<p>I was a complete failure at the game. I’d like to say it was simply because IT WAS SO GROSS, but, if I am being honest, I should really blame my more-than-pathetic flinging abilities. As you can see in the following picture, Roy was less than satisfied with my “touch as little as possible” flinging method.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/04/i-flung-the-tongue/easter-070/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/04/easter-070-325x465.jpg" alt="" title="easter 070" /></a></p>

<p>I realize this post has almost nothing to do with crafts, but I thought you all would enjoy hearing about this unusual method of celebration.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/04/i-flung-the-tongue/easter-087/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/04/easter-087-575x564.jpg" alt="" title="easter 087" /></a></p>

<p>And, if you are disappointed in the irrelevance of this post,I hope you are able to at least appreciate the beautiful East Tennessee scenery. Happy Easter!</p>

<p>This morning I dragged my lazy bones out of bed at 6:30 and drove over to Grandview Christian Church, to help Linda set up for a workshop of sorts. Linda was guest speaking/teaching on the topic of flower ministries.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/04/early-morning-flowers/flowers-and-salad-035-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/04/flowers-and-salad-035-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="flowers and salad 035" /></a></p>

<p>As the go-to-flower gal around Grandview, Linda is well known around church, which is how I came to work on the farm with her.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/04/early-morning-flowers/flowers-and-salad-036/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/04/flowers-and-salad-036-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="flowers and salad 036" /></a></p>

<p>She faithfully donates her beautiful arrangements to Grandview services every week for all to enjoy.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/04/early-morning-flowers/flowers-and-salad-045/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/04/flowers-and-salad-045-325x433.jpg" alt="" title="flowers and salad 045" /></a></p>

<p>Flowers are a wonderful way to get involved at your local church. Don’t grow cut flowers? That’s ok! You would be amazed at the variety of arrangements you can make with tree branches, grasses, and even weeds.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/04/early-morning-flowers/flowers-and-salad-013/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/04/flowers-and-salad-013-325x433.jpg" alt="" title="flowers and salad 013" /></a></p>

<p>The pictures I’ve included are just a few from this morning’s workshop and should demonstrate how simple starting your own flower ministry could be. Enjoy!</p>

    <p>A couple weekends ago I attended a baby shower for the most stylish mom-to-be I have ever known. Seriously, she’s so classy I wish I was her. Anyways, the invitation I received asked if I would contribute a children’s book for story time, I decided to continue the story time theme and also make her baby girl this pretty quilt to snuggle into while mom reads her favorite tales.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/10/babys-storytime-quilt/simple-strip-baby-quilt-6/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/10/simple-strip-baby-quilt-6-575x382.jpg" alt="" title="simple strip baby quilt (6)" /></a></p>

<p>This little quilt was very simple as it was my first and didn’t take much time to piece together as I stuck with simple strips instead of squares. I cut 2 pieces of fabric the size of my large rubber cutting mat (a simple and easy measurement to make). I also cut one piece of batting the same size. Next I took one of the pieces of fabric and cut it into 4-1/2 in. strips.</p>

<p>Once all my cutting was complete, I placed two strips together, right sides facing each other and sewed up the one long side, 1/4 in. from the edge. I unfolded those two strips and aligned a third strip next to the second strip, once again with right sides facing each other and sewed 1/4 in. in from the edge. Now unfolded, I have three connected strips of fabric. Continue to join strips until all are combined into one piece. Iron flat.</p>

<p>Place a piece of batting on the wrong side of the pieced together square of fabric. Pin together. Now sew along the lines that join each individual strip of fabric. This is how we are going to get a quilted look (see below).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/10/babys-storytime-quilt/simple-strip-baby-quilt-4/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/10/simple-strip-baby-quilt-4-575x382.jpg" alt="batting sew lines" title="simple strip baby quilt (4)" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/10/babys-storytime-quilt/simple-strip-baby-quilt-5/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/10/simple-strip-baby-quilt-5-575x382.jpg" alt="" title="simple strip baby quilt (5)" /></a></p>

<p>Once you have sewn down all the lines, lay the untouched piece of fabric (the back piece with no stitching) right side up, then place the pieced-together fabric with batting right side down (batting up). So the batting is on top, attached to the wrong side of the front of the quilt and the right side of the front of the quilt is facing down and touching the right side of the back of the quilt. Confused yet?</p>

<p>Now pin the pieces together. Your top piece will most likely be a bit smaller than the other two pieces so once pinned, take your rotary cutter and trim the edges to match the size of the top piece. Now comes the sewing. Sew around all 4 edges of the fabric pieces, leaving a 4-5 in. opening on one of the long sides. Make sure you capture all the layers as you sew around the quilt.</p>

<p>Now, reach into the opening and pull the opposite corners through the slit, essentially turning your blanket inside out or in reality, right side out. Once this is done. Iron all the edges and iron under the small section that was left open. Sew a 1/4 in. from the edge all the way around the blanket making sure to catch the fabric at the opening in your sew line (see below).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/10/babys-storytime-quilt/simple-strip-baby-quilt-1/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/10/simple-strip-baby-quilt-1-575x373.jpg" alt="quilted edges" title="simple strip baby quilt (1)" /></a></p>

<p>That’s it. You should now have a very sweet little baby quilt. Now that you have the general idea you can make another attempt and add ribbon along the edges, switch up the fabric strip patterns and textures, or switch to squares instead of strips. Good luck!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/10/babys-storytime-quilt/simple-strip-baby-quilt-8/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/10/simple-strip-baby-quilt-8-575x382.jpg" alt="" title="simple strip baby quilt (8)" /></a></p>

    <p>Last weekend’s jungle party was a success! I took way too many pictures so these collages are my attempt to show you all the details. To be completely honest, the jungle theme was pretty easy to pull off–think grasses, lots of them. That’s right, I used vases and vases of grasses and hosta leaves to bring the jungle indoors.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/08/jungle-safari-baby-shower/junglebabyshowerdecorations/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/08/junglebabyshowerdecorations-575x411.jpg" alt="jungle baby shower decorations" title="junglebabyshowerdecorations" /></a></p>

<p>For the table, I bought three yards of animal-print fabric and used a strip of burlap to break up the pattern down the middle of the table. I used green glass dishes to continue our nature theme and bring color to the table. I also cut grasses with branching brown ends on top to add a bit of nature and height to the table.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/08/jungle-safari-baby-shower/junglebabyshower-decorations-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/08/junglebabyshower-decorations-2-575x359.jpg" alt="jungle baby shower decorations" title="junglebabyshower decorations (2)" /></a></p>

<p>The next step to creating this jungle safari table was to make brown tissue paper poms. There are many tutorials for making these poms and I promise they are all very simple. For tutorials however, I usually revert to my good friend, <a href="http://www.marthastewart.com/how-to/tissue-paper-pom-poms-how-to">Martha Stewart</a> (cause she’s awesome).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/08/jungle-safari-baby-shower/junglebabyshower-decorations-3/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/08/junglebabyshower-decorations-3-575x359.jpg" alt="jungle baby  shower decorations tissue poms" title="junglebabyshower decorations (3)" /></a></p>

<p>To help give the table dimension and to label the food, I made little sachets with fabric squares, wooden skewers and circle tags (tutorial coming soon). I have never liked my handwriting so I used a fancy stencil to write out the food labels.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/08/jungle-safari-baby-shower/shower-gifts-and-decor/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/08/shower-gifts-and-decor-575x359.jpg" alt="jungle shower decor" title="jungle shower decor" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/08/jungle-safari-baby-shower/junglebabyshower-decorations-4/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/08/junglebabyshower-decorations-4-575x359.jpg" alt="jungle baby  shower decorations food labels" title="junglebabyshower decorations (4)" /></a></p>

<p>I also set up a little card station at the party. We pre-purchased a set of thank-you cards and a book of stamps for the parents-to-be. Then I set up the card station for guests to write their name and address on envelopes so the parents-to-be wouldn’t have to find everyone’s addresses on their own. The station had a giraffe-print fabric square, grasses, a basket for the written-on envelopes, and of course the thank-you cards and pens.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/08/jungle-safari-baby-shower/junglebabyshower-decorations-6/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/08/junglebabyshower-decorations-6-575x359.jpg" alt="jungle baby  shower decorations card station" title="jungle baby  shower decorations card station" /></a></p>

<p>I drew 2ft. jungle animals on black card stock and taped them in various areas around the house. I am hoping to make you all some printable stencils for my jungle animals so keep checking back. I also printed out cautionary signs: “Elephant XING”/”Do Not Feed the Animals”/”Trespassers Will Be Eaten”</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/08/jungle-safari-baby-shower/junglebabyshower-decorations-7/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/08/junglebabyshower-decorations-7-575x359.jpg" alt="jungle baby  shower decorations jungle animals" title="jungle baby  shower decorations jungle animals" /></a></p>

<p>In the gift area I switched from brown animal print fabric squares to black and white. If you can find animal print fabric for cheap just buy it in yards and cut it into squares. I could not find any inexpensive animal print fabrics so I opted for the $.99 fabric squares from Walmart (they have bunches of prints available). Notice in the picture my hanging <a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/06/jungle-paper-mobile/">paper jungle mobiles</a>, none of the pictures of those were that great but I had them hung around the gift opening area and in the sunroom.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/08/jungle-safari-baby-shower/junglebabyshower-decorations-10/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/08/junglebabyshower-decorations-10-575x359.jpg" alt="jungle baby  shower decorations zebra print" title="jungle baby  shower decorations zebra print" /></a></p>

<p>Another station was set up for the guests to leave an encouraging message for the parents to be. I used leaf and flower-print card stock, a hole punch, and twine to make little hanging notes. I also brought some of my potted plants from home for the table greenery. Behind this station, I lined small clear bottles filled with grasses to create a grass wall separating the front room from the kitchen.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/08/jungle-safari-baby-shower/junglebabyshower-decorations-8/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/08/junglebabyshower-decorations-8-575x359.jpg" alt="jungle baby shower decorations notes" title="jungle baby shower decorations notes" /></a></p>

<p>My last jungle station held the party favors. My hubby makes himself loads and loads of yummy granola for snacks so I convinced him to make me a very large batch for the party. Then I scooped out one cup of granola for each ziplock bag, wrapped the bag in burlap squares and tied them off with twine.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/08/jungle-safari-baby-shower/junglebabyshower-decorations-9/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/08/junglebabyshower-decorations-9-575x359.jpg" alt="jungle baby shower decorations party favor granola treats" title="jungle baby shower decorations party favor granola treats" /></a></p>

<p>This was such a fun party to plan and I think a fun time was had by all the guests and most importantly the parents-to-be. I hope these pictures serve as inspiration for your next party. I’ll try to post a few tutorials for the miscellaneous jungle decorations very soon.</p>

    <p>Wedding bouquets are by far my favorite flower piece to arrange. There are multiple factors to consider when planning a bridal bouquet. Many brides put all their creativity and thought into the flower type and completely forget to adorn the bouquet handle. Adding a bit of glam to the bouquet handle is simple and can make a huge impact. One of my favorite handle wrap techniques is the <em>classic braid</em> adorned with pearl corsage pins. This is the braid technique I used on last week’s <a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/07/silver-gold-brooch-bouquet/">bridal brooch bouquet</a>? This simple classic braid is simple, elegant and fail-safe.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/06/ribbon-braided-bouquet/bridalbroochbraid-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/06/bridalbroochbraid-2-575x382.jpg" alt="bridal brooch bouquet" title="bridalbroochbraid (2)" /></a></p>

<p><em>Preparation:</em></p>

<p>Arrange your flowers and tie with a rubber band close to the neck. Cover the rubber band with green floral tape, then proceed down the stems as far as you want your braid to run. Leave at least 1 inch of the stems exposed at the bottom. If you want to cover the entire bottom of the stems as well, you need to wait until the day of or find some really great ribbon that won’t fall out of place after being soaked in water all night.</p>

<p>Choose your ribbon, a medium width is best. Place your bouquet on it’s side with the “front” facing you (the side that will not face the bride). If you are braiding up the majority of the stems, use 1 entire roll of ribbon. You may end up cutting some off at the end but it is better than running short and this technique uses much more ribbon than you might think.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/06/ribbon-braided-bouquet/brooch-bouquet-and-braid/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/06/brooch-bouquet-and-braid-575x359.jpg" alt="brooch bouquet and braid" title="brooch bouquet and braid" /></a></p>

<p><em>The Braid:</em></p>

<p>Step #1: Starting at the <em>bottom</em> of your stems, wrap the ribbon around the back of the stem bundle and even up the two sides of ribbon. Hold the ribbons up toward you and taut.</p>

<p>Step #2: Cross the ribbons, one in front of the other two times. You are basically switching the ribbon from your left hand to your right and back again. You should have a twisted tangle of ribbon now. Now pull the ribbons to their separate sides, this should move something resembling a knot down toward the stems.</p>

<p>Step #3: Cross your ribbons around the back of the stems to switch their sides. Repeat the crossing in front by once again crossing the two strands around each other twice then pulling the strands away from each other to move the knot down.</p>

<p>Step #4: As you tighten each “knot,” try to keep them in line with one another and make sure you are overlapping the ribbon all the way up the stems so there are no gaps.</p>

<p>Step #5: Continue to braid your ribbon to the neck of the flowers and finish the braid by either tying a knot or a bow. If you have extra ribbon, measure the strands to the end of your bouquet stems and cut each at an angle.</p>

<p>Step #6: Using short corsage pins, place one at the base of each knot to dress up your braid. Push the pins in and up so they don’t poke out the other side of the stem bundle and stab the bride.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/07/ribbon-braid-bouquet-diy/dsc_0050-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/07/DSC_0050-325x541.jpg" alt="bridesmaid ribbon mini braid" title="bridesmaid ribbon mini braid" /></a>While the bride may enjoy having a full braid that covers the entire length of the stems, bridesmaids often opt for the mini-braid which covers only a portion of the bouquet handle. This technique (seen in the picture at right) follows the same steps but it is only necessary to wrap a small portion of the stem with floral tape–just enough to cover the rubber band.</p>

<p>I hope these pictures are helpful. Ribbon braiding really is a very simple and quick process. As always, please let me know if you have any questions.</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/07/wood-panel-wall-art/woodpanelwallartsat/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/07/woodpanelwallartsat-325x487.jpg" alt="wood panel wall art" title="woodpanelwallartsat" /></a>The last few months I have noticed a plethora of wooden-variety signs and art making their debut on the pages of Pinterest. I have struggled to come up with an idea that could turn the hundreds of extremely creative ideas into one project that I can truly call my own–my idea, my style, my brain child. Although I am one of the biggest supporters of Pinterest, I find it becomes more &amp; more difficult to be original after seeing the incredible ideas submitted by users. Really, I just want to make exact replicas of most of the projects I see, but no, I push on and try to make each project my own. I think I did just that with this plywood art.</p>

<p>I received this beautiful Monet print from my friend Kristin after her recent excursion to D.C. with her junior high students (isn’t she sweet). I struggled with the many ways to really make the print stand out on the vast expanse of white wall currently found in our apartment. Originally I started this project thinking I would just paint a cute saying of some sort on the boards but luckily the print came to mind and the finished result makes me happy.</p>

<p><strong>Wood Panel Art</strong></p>

<p><em>Materials:</em></p>

<p>2-8ft 1x4in boards<br />
1-4ft 1×1-1/2in board<br />
1 bag of 2in screws<br />
1 small jar of wood stain<br />
3 colors of paint (mine were gray and blue and yellow)<br />
1 canvas frame<br />
1 print<br />
60-grit sandpaper</p>

<p><em>Instructions:</em></p>

<p>Cut the two 1x4in boards into three-2 1/2ft long pieces and sand.</p>

<p>After sanding, stain two of the boards with wood stain. Set aside.</p>

<p>Next, get your other two paint colors ready. Dip your brush into the paint and then swirl around in a cup of water so the paint is extremely watery. You want to use your paint sort of like a watercolor and let the watery tint soak into the board. So, to reiterate, you aren’t really “painting” the board but more “tinting” the board. Got it?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/07/wood-panel-wall-art/woodpanelwallart-3/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/07/woodpanelwallart-3-575x384.jpg" alt="painted wood panels" title="woodpanelwallart (3)" /></a></p>

<p>Allow the boards to dry. Meanwhile, take your 1×1-1/2in board and cut two pieces long enough to fit horizontally across the back of your boards (20in each). This is what you will screw your 2-1/2ft pieces into.</p>

<p>Take your canvas frame and paint it using your third color (mine was bright yellow to accent the yellow sunflowers). Let dry.</p>

<p>Come back to your stained and painted boards and begin to sand the edges and tops until you achieve the desired amount of weathering.</p>

<p>Now it is time to assemble. Turn your boards over so the front is facedown. Stagger the boards and place the 1×1-1/2in boards across the back horizontally, one toward the top and one toward the bottom (see picture). Screw the boards to the blocks.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/07/wood-panel-wall-art/woodpanelwallart-1/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/07/woodpanelwallart-1-575x382.jpg" alt="wood panel wall art" title="woodpanelwallart (1)" /></a></p>

<p>Once all the boards are secure, turn the pallet over and glue your print to the center with craft glue.</p>

<p>Last of all, take the painted frame and using wood glue, attach the frame around your print.</p>

<p>This project took about 6 hours for me to make. The longest part is sanding and drying time, but overall it is fairly simple to throw together.</p>

    <p>I am constantly writing to you about buying flowers locally and arranging them yourself for special events or weddings but what about those specialty pieces like corsages and boutonnieres? Can you also make these yourself? The answer is “yes &amp; yes” and I’m ready to show you how.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/07/how-to-boutonniere/bluegrayboutonniere-6/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/07/bluegrayboutonniere-6-575x382.jpg" alt="blue gray boutonniere how to" title="bluegrayboutonniere (6)" /></a></p>

<p>This little boutonniere is incredibly simple to make and uses items that are hardy enough to remain upright even when out of water overnight. When we make boutonnieres for weddings on the farm, they are usually assembled the afternoon prior to the wedding, at the same time we arrange centerpieces and bouquets. If you know what to use, this is not too far ahead of the event to assemble the boutonniere. Once you have finished assembling all your bouts, simply store in the refrigerator until the big event.</p>

<p>When choosing stems for your bout, be sure to choose ones that are hardy. This bout uses Ivy as the backing, dusty miller, blue thistle, dianthus and a small succulent.</p>

<p><em>Assembly:</em></p>

<p>Step 1: Find a flat surface and lay out one leaf of Ivy. Lay one leaf of Dusty Miller on top.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/07/how-to-boutonniere/bluegrayboutonniere-8/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/07/bluegrayboutonniere-8-575x411.jpg" alt="" title="bluegrayboutonniere (8)" /></a></p>

<p>Step 2: Now add a small piece of blue thistle on top of the Dusty Miller and slightly left of center.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/07/how-to-boutonniere/bluegrayboutonniere-1/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/07/bluegrayboutonniere-1-575x410.jpg" alt="blue gray boutonniere how to" title="bluegrayboutonniere (1)" /></a></p>

<p>Step 3: Lay the Dianthus to the right of the thistle.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/07/how-to-boutonniere/bluegrayboutonniere-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/07/bluegrayboutonniere-2-575x411.jpg" alt="blue gray boutonniere how to" title="bluegrayboutonniere (2)" /></a></p>

<p>Step 4: Push the succulent up under the Dianthus and slightly to the right of center. You should position the succulent so that it is sort of supporting the Dianthus, that way, even if it decides to wilt it will be supported and go unnoticed.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/07/how-to-boutonniere/bluegrayboutonniere-3/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/07/bluegrayboutonniere-3-575x411.jpg" alt="blue gray boutonniere how to" title="bluegrayboutonniere (3)" /></a></p>

<p>Step 5: Now you want to add a smaller Ivy leaf to the front of the bout, right underneath the succulent giving it a sort of clam-like appearance (sorry I forgot this picture, but look at the finished product up top and you will see what I mean).</p>

<p>Step 6: Pinch the stems together right underneath the heads of the stems and cut the stems and varying lengths. This is helpful for those of you who want to cover the stems with ribbon, it makes a gradual thickening as you up the stems toward the flowers.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/07/how-to-boutonniere/bluegrayboutonniere-4/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/07/bluegrayboutonniere-4-575x382.jpg" alt="blue gray boutonniere how to" title="bluegrayboutonniere (4)" /></a></p>

<p>Step 7: While holding the stems tightly with one hand, grab your roll of florist tape and begin to wrap the stems at the neck of the bout. If you just want a simple bout without ribbon, continue to wrap the stems all the way down with the florist tape (ribbon wrap tutorial to come).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/07/how-to-boutonniere/bluegrayboutonniere-5/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/07/bluegrayboutonniere-5-575x410.jpg" alt="blue gray boutonniere how to" title="bluegrayboutonniere (5)" /></a></p>

<p>There you have it, one <em>very</em> simple boutonniere crash course. Don’t forget to be creative with your materials–there are an endless possibilities when making your bout. One of my all-time favorite items to use is dried wheat or barley for a vintage look.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/07/how-to-boutonniere/bluegrayboutonniere-7/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/07/bluegrayboutonniere-7-575x411.jpg" alt="blue gray boutonniere how to" title="bluegrayboutonniere (7)" /></a></p>

    <p>Hello friends, Jack and I just got back from a mini-vacation to see the family–at least some of them. So, to make up for missing Floral Friday, here is a little post on a beautiful and bold wedding arrangement made for a bright wedding two weeks ago.</p>

<p>Seriously, isn’t this arrangement gorgeous?!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/06/bold-bright-wedding-arrangement/brightweddingflowers-1/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/06/brightweddingflowers-1-325x488.jpg" alt="Bright Wedding Flower Arrangement" title="brightweddingflowers (1)" /></a></p>

<p>I can’t get over how simple and breathtaking these flowers are, and so simple. Some of my favorite flowers are the ones that grow in mixed colors, you see this effect with flowers like Dahlias, which no one can deny they are beautiful. However, there is something about the pure colors–especially pure and bold like this arrangement.</p>

<p>This arrangement began in a pastel-colored pitcher but we discovered white was the only way to go. The flowers are gorgeous on their own and a colored pitcher didn’t make as big of a statement. Here’s another picture for you.</p>

<p><em>Stems:</em></p>

<p>Pink Peonies<br />
Magenta Snapdragons<br />
White Snapdragons<br />
Blue Delphinium<br />
Sunflowers<br />
Hosta Leaves<br />
Bells of Ireland<br />
Ornamental Grasses</p>

<p><em>Arrangement:</em></p>

<p>This arrangement starts out a bit different from what I normally recommend. There is not much filler used so I would start with your tall stems that are used most, in this case the snapdragons. Next, add in the little bit of filler–Bells of Ireland (the green things that look like bells–just in case you needed help with that).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/06/bold-bright-wedding-arrangement/brightweddingflowers-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/06/brightweddingflowers-2-575x382.jpg" alt="Bright Wedding Flower Arrangement" title="brightweddingflowers (2)" /></a></p>

<p>Now we need to focus on pulling the eye downward. Start by placing pink peonies low in the arrangement, nearly to the vase rim. The sunflowers have large stems so I would cut those lower than the snaps but higher than the peonies. Make sure you don’t cut them all the exact same height, you want these to be varied throughout the middle third of the arrangement height. Add these next since they will fill large holes and take up much of the vase space.</p>

<p>Now you can add the delicate-stemmed delphinium for beautiful pops of bluish-purple color. Finally add the Hosta leaves around the rim of the vase, as if cradling the peonies. Hosta leaves give the eye an end point for the arrangement.</p>

    <p>A few weeks ago I had the privilege of helping Linda with flower arrangements for a vintage wedding. If you haven’t figured it out before, it seems the go-to flower for vintage is the beautiful peony. And really, who would argue with that choice? The peony is absolutely exquisite in all colors but this coral color is by far my favorite. I could look at it for hours. Really? Not even kidding.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/05/coral-peony-bridal-bouquet/antiquewedding-3/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/05/antiquewedding-3-575x382.jpg" alt="" title="antiquewedding (3)" /></a></p>

<p>Here’s another look, in case you too, can’t stop staring.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/05/coral-peony-bridal-bouquet/antiquewedding-2-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/05/antiquewedding-2-575x382.jpg" alt="" title="antiquewedding (2)" /></a></p>

<p>Alrighty then, tearing eyes away, closing mouth, moving on…</p>

<p>The bridal bouquet was made mainly with white and coral peonies, white stock, yellow, white &amp; peach ranunculus, chartreuse-colored physocarpis, and bells of Ireland.</p>

<p>Bouquets are different than arrangements in styling order. With arrangements you typically want to start by placing your filler since that will take up more of the vase space. With bouquets however, filler is much more scarce so you actually begin with your flowers, and usually the bulkier flowers first to provide support to the smaller stems.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/05/coral-peony-bridal-bouquet/antiquewedding-5/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/05/antiquewedding-5-575x382.jpg" alt="" title="antiquewedding (5)" /></a></p>

<p>So, can you guess which flower we start with here? That’s right, the peonies! Group a few peonies in the middle, then add a white stock in between each peony. Then add a few Bells of Ireland stems around the edges of the peonies and stocks, follow with an outer layer of peonies in the open spaces.</p>

<p>As you move toward the outer edges of your bouquet, make sure you are continuing to push the outer edges upward instead of letting them fall low. With bridal and bridesmaid bouquets you want to see all of the flowers at the top, not lose them down underneath at the spot where you would hold the bouquet, make sense?</p>

<p>Alright, now all that’s left is filling in the spaces and adding a few pops of color and filler. This bouquet has Phisocarpus leaves placed sporadically throughout for a bit of added filler and little peach, white, and yellow Ranunculus for added color. Hold the bouquet lower on the stems as you add flowers. This allows the bouquet to sit loosely giving you plenty of wiggle room for adding stems in last minute or even pulling a few out.</p>

<p>And of course, if you like the look, add Hosta leaves around the very bottom to create a collar. This gives the eye an end point and keeps the focus on the flowers above the collar instead of trailing off into nothingness.</p>

<p>There are a few basic methods to arranging flowers. For an arrangement like the one shown above, it is best to start with your bulky flowers (the white lilacs) as those take up a lot of space and make filling in the rest of the arrangement fairly simple. Place 3-5 stems of lilacs of varying heights in your container–the number of stems depends on their size and the size of your container. Angle each stem in a different direction (or if they are smaller you can try grouping).</p>

<p>With an arrangement this size I would next fill in with greenery to add support and stability to your lilacs, also providing a sturdy base for the more delicate flowers. The greenery in this arrangement is simply the drooping foliage from a lilac bush on the farm. Make sure you add greenery both around the lip of the container, giving it the spillover effect, as well as tall and short stems in and around the lilacs to add dimension.</p>

<p>Next, add your color. This is usually a more delicate stem, so be sure to place gently and secure well amid the greenery. Linda used tulips for her color.</p>

<p>Finally, in order to really make the tulips stand out, Linda added a chartreuse color of greenery to the mix. Chartreuse greenery is one of my all-time favorite items to add to arrangements. Although dark greenery is pretty, it is still dark, making your one bright color a big leap from the dark green. The chartreuse color bridges this dark-light gap and allows the brightness of the flower to pop while keeping the overall arrangement in balance. The chartreuse-colored stem in this arrangement is physocarpus.</p>

<p>The wonderful thing about this arrangement is most people with a garden have these flowers. The flowers are not anything out of the ordinary and you can substitute the greenery with just about any shrub or decorative grass in your own backyard.</p>

<p>I hope you’ve enjoyed these quick and simple steps to building a beautiful flower arrangement for your home. Happy arranging!</p>

    <p>Spring is in the air here in East Tennessee and our household is gearing up for another attempt at container gardening. Although we love our little apartment, one very unfortunate downside is the inability to put our budding green thumbs to work. Since Jack and I very much enjoy the labors of tending a garden, we had to figure out a way to make due without a plot of land.</p>

<p>Our first year in Tennessee, we purchased a few inexpensive starter pots for a bit of trial and error in East Tennessee growing. The second year, we got smarter. We borrowed three large cylinder buckets from Linda out at <a href="http://www.auntwillieswildflowers.com">Aunt Willies Wildflowers</a> that were deep enough to allow better root growth for larger plants. The buckets aren’t pretty but our tomatoes grew much bigger and stronger because of them. We also attempted to put together our <a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/diy-planter-box/">first planter box</a>. When this project was attempted however, Jack did not own his own saw or a decent drill so we relied heavily on the great staff over at Home Depot to make the appropriate cuts for us.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/03/how-to-build-a-planter-box/planter-box-1/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/03/planter-box-1-325x403.jpg" alt="" title="planter-box-1" /></a></p>

<p>This last Christmas, Jack was gifted a new saw and drill (you can imagine how much our neighbors are loving us this Spring). Jack’s biggest goal with his new toys has been building wall book shelves that work around his desk. This is a slow process and we have had some extra wood pieces lying around the house because of the project. Last weekend, with the beautiful weather beckoning us outdoors, we decided to get the porch ready for planting and since we had the materials, we decided to build our second planter box too. This one is WAY better!</p>

<p>I asked the lovely husband to write up these simple instructions for those of you looking to container garden this spring.<br />
Please don’t hesitate to shoot us an email if you have any questions.</p>
<nbsp>  
_Tools &amp; Materials:_</nbsp>

<p>Plywood sheet-whatever size you want (we used 3/4″ plywood that was 8′ x 14″)<br />
8 L-Brackets<br />
1 package of Screen Door nylon<br />
Wide head tacks or staple gun<br />
1 extra piece of lumber-(4′ 1×4)<br />
Wood screws or nails</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/03/how-to-build-a-planter-box/planter-box-2-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/03/planter-box-21-325x244.jpg" alt="" title="planter-box-2" /></a><em>Directions:</em></p>

<ol>
  <li>Cut four equal (and they really do need to be equal!) lengths of wood (I used some scrap 3/4” plywood that was 8′ x 14”).</li>
  <li>Attach L-brackets to each side, forming a square.</li>
  <li>Cut a sufficient amount of screen material to cover the bottom of the box (I use twice as much and doubled it over).</li>
  <li>Using a staple gun (or tacks with a wide head) fasten the screen material to the bottom of the box, keeping it tight.</li>
  <li>Fold the excess screen material back inward (under the box) and staple it. This serves a two-fold purpose—it gives some strength to the staples (in case the screen rips) and it hides the excess without having to cut it off.</li>
  <li>Cut two equal lengths of a smaller kind of lumber (I used a 4′ 1×4) and miter the ends at a 45º angle, making each look like a trapezoid (viz. not a parallellogram).</li>
  <li>Screw (or nail, if you’re brave) the two 1x4s to the bottom of the box diagonally.</li>
</ol>

<p>That’s it! The quick and dirty way to throw together a planter box for Spring. Of course, you can grab some outdoor stain or sealant if you’d like to further protect the box. We, however, have come to like the gray, weathered look of our first box and thus decided not to treat the wood at all.</p>

<p>I hope this helps. Once again feel free to email us with any questions or clarification needs.</p>

<p>Happy Building!</p>

    <p>Jack and I are always looking for low-calorie, high protein and of course, good tasting snacks to hold us over throughout the busy day. We have been trying out various trail mix varieties over the last few weeks and finally figured out an inexpensive way to make our very own.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/03/granola-trail-mix/homemadegranola/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/03/homemadegranola-325x488.jpg" alt="homemade granola" title="homemadegranola" /></a>Instead of using a nut-based mix, we decided to use granola as the main ingredient and add in mixed nuts, M&amp;Ms, and craisins. We bought a bulk bag of craisins for $3 and a bulk nuts for $4.</p>

<p>As for the granola, all it takes is a few cups of old-fashioned oats.</p>

<p><em>Granola:</em></p>

<p>3 c. old-fashioned oats<br />
3 tbsp. brown sugar<br />
1/4 tsp. salt<br />
1/2 tsp. cinnamon<br />
1/3 c. honey<br />
1/4 c. canola oil<br />
1 tsp. vanilla</p>

<nbsp>  
<nbsp>  
_Directions:_</nbsp></nbsp>

<p>Preheat oven to 300 degrees Fahrenheit. Combine oats, sugar, salt and cinnamon in a large bowl. Combine remaining ingredients in a separate bowl. Pour honey mixture over oats-coat thoroughly. Once the oats are coated, spread onto a cookie sheet, thin and even. Place in oven. Stir the granola at least every 12 minutes to keep it from burning–you really don’t want this to burn. Remove granola from oven after 30 minutes or when oats turn a golden brown. Allow to cool completely. Add mixed nuts, fruit, chocolate, craisins or whatever else you can think of to spice up your trail mix. Here’s where I learned all about <a href="http://www.chow.com/food-news/55265/how-to-make-granola/">granola making</a>.</p>

<p>Adding fruit to your mix can become quite expensive, however you can easily dry your own fruit pieces. Jack is currently drying mangoes to add to our mix–yummy!</p>

<p>I used 1/4 of the bag of craisins and 1/4 the box of nuts with 1 batch of oats to yield about 8 cups of trail mix. Why is this important to note? We can make a few more batches!</p>

<p>You can also skip the trail mix and simply eat the granola for breakfast.</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/01/christmas-party-a-few-tips/christmas2011-215/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/01/Christmas2011-215-e1325875811866-325x489.jpg" alt="" title="Christmas2011-215" /></a> What holiday homecoming is complete without dressing up at least once for a Christmas party? Many individuals are put off by throwing their own party because, let’s face it, organizing an event on top of work and family can at times seem daunting. As soon as Jack and I knew we would be flying home for Christmas this year, I begged my mom to let me throw a little shindig at their house. These are a few of the set-up pictures.</p>

<p>When planning a holiday get-together, be sure to choose quick, easy and inexpensive treats that can feed a large group. In keeping with this rule, I decided to make bruschetta. This dish requires tomatoes, cucumber, onion, and feta–all fairly inexpensive and best of all, a little goes a long way. Jack even made baguettes to go along with the bruschetta and save a little money. My parents also decided to buy one HoneyBaked Ham to avoid the hassle of baking all day, and lots of wine.<a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/01/christmas-party-a-few-tips/christmas2011-290-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/01/Christmas2011-2901-325x215.jpg" alt="" title="Baguette Bread" /></a></p>

<p>Another way to lower the stress and remain in budget is to simply ask your friends and family to bring something to share. Many people think they are required to provide everything for the party but most guests are more than happy to contribute and don’t even need to be asked. Remember, it is OK to let go of some of the party-planning responsibility…a tip I find myself repeating often.</p>

<p>Simple is better. Cheese, crackers, wine–even three themed ingredients can make a successful party. We had a wine and cheese bar at the party. My aunt and uncle contributed an out-of this-world homemade tomato jam (recipe to come), that we paired with crackers and various cheeses. I filled up on this combination alone. <a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/01/christmas-party-a-few-tips/christmas2011-283/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/01/Christmas2011-283-325x217.jpg" alt="" title="Wine and Cheese" /></a><br />
A few of the contributed foods included: pumpkin dip and gingersnaps (courtesy of my sister), meatballs (mother-in-law), more cheese and cracker plates (you can never have too many), ham, pickle, and cream cheese rolls (sister-in-law), and more wine.</p>

<p>For the non-wine drinkers, we also created a fun little space for a hot chocolate bar. I emptied cocoa and marshmallows into tins from home depot, and filled a teapot with hot water right before the guests arrived. I also filled clear containers with cinnamon sticks for stirring, and pirouettes to pair with their drinks. We set out the mugs ahead of time for easy access and also decorated the cocoa bar with various desserts, Costco truffles on shiny flower cut outs and blackberry pie. <a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/01/christmas-party-a-few-tips/christmas2011-277/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/01/Christmas2011-277-575x208.jpg" alt="" title="Hot Chocolate Bar" /></a></p>

<p>To decorate, we simply used ornaments and candles to add ambiance and sparkle to the decor. Once again, simple and inexpensive is the key to throwing your own party. <a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/01/christmas-party-a-few-tips/christmas2011-604/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/01/Christmas2011-604-325x434.jpg" alt="" title="Kendra and Grammy" /></a>This should be an enjoyable process, not one that will cause stress. Decide ahead of time your budget, time requirements, and how many people you are willing to host. If you aren’t sure, start small and in time, throwing a party will be as easy as 1-2-3.</p>

<p>Remember it’s not about the party, it’s about the people–Coming together with those you love. I hope you’ve enjoyed the pictures from our little holiday party and I hope your holiday gatherings were as joyful and refreshing as ours was. Happy New Year!</p>

    <p>Are you ready for the easiest pillowcase-making tutorial ever?! I know I’ve mentioned it before, but I like my projects to look fabulous and take a grand total of 10 minutes. It’s not that I’m impatient (I am) and it’s not that I get bored easily (I do), the problem is I have too many things to do and not enough time to do them (right). Whatever the reasoning, these pillowcases satisfy my need to craft along with my A.D.D. lifestyle.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/09/10-minute-pillowcase-tutorial/sandwich-pillows-small-flowers-156/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/07/sandwich-pillows-small-flowers-156-575x381.jpg" alt="" title="sandwich, pillows, small flowers 156" /></a></p>

<p>First, cut a strip of fabric that will wrap once + 8 in. around the pillow (meaning the fabric should fold around the pillow snugly and overlap itself by 8 in.). This fabric should also be 2 inches wider than the pillow. You want the pillowcase to look full so don’t worry about cutting the sides of your fabric too small.</p>

<p>Next, hem in one end (not side) of the fabric, 1/2 in, nothing fancy, just a simple fold over and hem.</p>

<p>After hemming, place fabric right side up with the unhemmed side closest to you. Fold about 1/3 of the fabric on the hemmed side down (toward you), so right sides touch. This edge will end up being on the outside of the pillow.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/09/10-minute-pillowcase-tutorial/sandwich-pillows-small-flowers-137-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/07/sandwich-pillows-small-flowers-137-2-575x402.jpg" alt="" title="sandwich, pillows, small flowers 137-2" /></a></p>

<p>Next, fold up (away from you) the unhemmed side and overlap the hemmed edge by 8 inches. (see picture). Your folds might not split the fabric exactly into thirds, the main point is that when you fold the unhemmed side back over the hemmed side, it MUST overlap by at least 8 inches.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/09/10-minute-pillowcase-tutorial/sandwich-pillows-small-flowers-139/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/07/sandwich-pillows-small-flowers-139-575x381.jpg" alt="" title="sandwich, pillows, small flowers 139" /></a></p>

<p>Pin in place. Sew a 1 in. strip down the two open sides. Flip pillowcase inside out.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/09/10-minute-pillowcase-tutorial/sandwich-pillows-small-flowers-141/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/07/sandwich-pillows-small-flowers-141-575x349.jpg" alt="" title="sandwich, pillows, small flowers 141" /></a></p>

<p>Insert pillow and enjoy your fabulous handiwork!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/09/10-minute-pillowcase-tutorial/sandwich-pillows-small-flowers-144/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/07/sandwich-pillows-small-flowers-144-575x390.jpg" alt="" title="sandwich, pillows, small flowers 144" /></a></p>

<p>I’ll be honest I’m not great at writing out tutorials so if you have questions or need more pictures of the process let me know. I’ll try to get a few more pics up to clarify the steps. Good luck and happy sewing!</p>

    <p><em>Our guest post this week comes from Meredith of <a href="http://blog.maeburn.org">Garden in the South</a>. Meredith is a talented cook, wife, and mother of two adorable children. She is our College Archivist and Information Resources Librarian. Jack and Meredith work together at the library and I’m so grateful they do because I have had the pleasure of getting to know her these past 2 years and she is fabulous! She cans, cooks, bakes amazing baklava and so much more. Please be sure to head over to her blog and show her a bit of love today.</em></p>

<p>First of all, I’d like to thank Tiffany for asking me to guest post! I blog (such as it is) at <a href="http://blog.maeburn.org" title="Garden in the South">Garden in the South</a>, but not nearly as often, or with as much focus as I’d like. <em>C’est la vie</em>, for now. But I love The Kitchen Curtains, and everything Tiffany posts I think, “Oooh! I want to try that!” So this is an honor.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/09/guest-post-mint-milk-with-chocolate-ice-cubes/mint/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/06/mint.jpg" alt="" title="mint" /></a></p>

    <tr>
      <td>The other day, my friend Sarah sent me a link to this [Vanilla Milk with Chocolate Ice Cubes](http://translate.google.com/translate?client=tmpg&amp;hl=en&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fsandrakavital.blogspot.com%2F2008%2F08%2Fchocolat-det-frais-et-gourmand.html&amp;langpair=fr</td>
      <td>en “Le Petrin”) at <em>Le Pétrin</em> (Google translates this as “Trouble.” That seems an apt title, given the deliciousness of this recipe, and how much of it I want to drink.) I had to make it immediately, but first I had to go to the store for some chocolate (because all of mine was old and chalky looking) and instant coffee powder (which I generally do without, but often wish I had). I considered Via, because it’s better, but went with Maxwell House, because I think it’ll mix in more completely, being that it’s freeze-dried. Via, which I’ll drink in a pinch, is super-finely ground, and so doesn’t dissolve well. Also, it’s crazy expensive. So $2 jar of Maxwell House it is.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>I also did not have a vanilla bean. Sarah used one for her Vanilla Milk, and I suspect it’s essential. In something this simple, extract might be a bit harsh. I also live far from my spice <a href="http://www.penzeys.com" title="Penzey's Spices">purveyor</a> of choice, and definitely couldn’t wait for shipping. But I do have a beautiful pot of fresh mint, and very fond memories of a <a href="http://www.williams-sonoma.com/recipe/fresh-mint-chocolate-truffle-tart.html" title="Pure deliciousness">Fresh Mint-Chocolate Truffle Tart</a> I’ve made a few times. Mint is refreshing, of course, and perfect for summer, but the herbal quality of the fresh mint steeped in the cream is a little unexpected and wonderful. So I decided to go with Mint Milk, instead. And I’m so very glad I did. I’m sure the Vanilla Milk is wonderful, but the Mint . . . Seriously. This might become a staple in my refrigerator. The Chocolate Ice is nice – it melts into the milk, and I think it’d be good in all sorts of drinks. But it was all my husband and I could do not to drink the milk right up, and make more immediately.</p>

<p>So here’s the recipe. I was going to be all helpful and do the metric-American conversion, but then I realized my handy 2-cup Pyrex has mls on the other side, and I’ll bet yours does, too.</p>

<p><strong>For the Chocolate Ice</strong>:</p>

<p>200 ml milk</p>

<p>50 ml water</p>

<p>1 T instant coffee</p>

<p>1 T unsweetened cocoa powder</p>

<p>1 t sugar</p>

<p>70 g dark chocolate, 66% (I used a combination of 82% and 60%, because I forgot to write down what I needed before I went to the store, and was thinking I was looking for 77%. It worked out ok.)</p>

<p>Whisk the coffee, cocoa powder, and sugar together in a small saucepan. Whisk in the milk &amp; water, and bring to a boil over medium heat, whisking often. Meanwhile, finely chop the chocolate, and put into heatproof, pourable vessel (I used the aforementioned 2-cup Pyrex.) Pour hot liquid over chocolate. Let stand a few minutes, and whisk smooth. (The original suggests a wooden spoon, but I’m pretty excited about my new 4-inch whisk, so I used it.) Pour into ice cube tray, and freeze. This made 12 cubes for me.</p>

<p><strong>For the Mint Milk</strong>:</p>

<p>600 ml milk (I used 500 ml 1%, which is what I had, with 100 ml 1/2 &amp; 1/2 for richness. I think I’d just use the 1% next time – I’m not sure the creaminess added that much.)</p>

<p>60 g sugar (about 1/4 cup)</p>

<p>8-10 sprigs fresh mint</p>

<p>Heat the milk &amp; sugar in a small saucepan over medium heat, stirring frequently. When milk is very hot and sugar dissolved, remove from heat, toss in mint sprigs, and cover. Let steep half an hour or so (I forgot to look at the clock when I started, which, of course, I didn’t realize until some time later.) Remove mint, and chill. I poured it through a strainer into a Mason jar, but there wasn’t really anything to strain out.</p>

<p><strong>To Serve</strong>:</p>

<p>Place 2-3 cubes chocolate in glasses, and pour milk over. This recipe makes 4 servings (at three cubes each, and milk divided 4 ways.) I think next time, I’ll double the milk, and use 2 cubes per serving. We had a hard time sipping slowly enough to let the chocolate melt in, and ended up topping off with regular milk (and a splash of Bailey’s) just so we’ll have more Mint Milk left for tonight. But, seriously, the Mint Milk? You <strong>must</strong> try it.</p>

    <p>On Memorial Day, we had a few of our close friends over for a little BBQ. The evening was enjoyable, filled with food, cornhole and a backstabbing game of phase10 twist. However, the evening was also a bit solemn as we said goodbye to two of our closest friends, Adam and Leslie Bean. A fabulous couple whom we feel privileged to have known these past 6 years. Adam was recently accepted to Johns Hopkins University so they will be moving to Baltimore after spending the summer at an archeological dig in Jordan.</p>

<p>I have never been good at saying goodbye to those I love. I usually end up awkwardly changing the subject. To this day I cringe when I remember my response to my favorite youth pastor of all time when he and his wife told me they were moving away…</p>

<p>“You’re moving? Well, you sure didn’t give us much time to throw you a going away party!” This is what I really wanted to say, “But, I love you! Why are you doing this to me! You can’t go!”</p>

<p>As you can see, I am definitely not one for goodbyes. So, what is my secret to dealing with them now? Cake!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/06/mocha-frosted-chocolate-cake/cake-017/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/06/cake-017-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="spikey cake!" /></a><br />
You can tell my degree of sadness by either the size of the cake or the amount of sugar added to it. I think the picture above should clue you in on how much we love the Beans.</p>

<p>This recipe is from the May issue of <em>Real Simple</em> magazine which had a section devoted to different cake, filling, and frosting combinations to mix and match.</p>

<p>This is what I came up with…</p>

<p>Mocha frosted double layer chocolate cake with white chocolate chips and chocolate shavings on top. If that doesn’t make saying goodbye easier, I don’t know what does.</p>

<p><strong>Chocolate Cake Ingredients:</strong></p>

<p>1 c. unsalted butter<br />
3/4 c. unsweetened cocoa powder<br />
2 c. all-purpose flour<br />
1 tsp. baking powder<br />
1 tsp. baking soda<br />
1 tsp. salt<br />
1-1/2 c. sugar<br />
2 tsp. vanilla<br />
3 eggs<br />
1-1/2 c. milk</p>

<p><strong>Chocolate Cake Instructions:</strong></p>

<p>Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Butter two circular pans, line with parchment paper, butter and sprinkle with cocoa powder.</p>

<p>Mix butter and sugar on high until fluffy. Add vanilla and eggs. On low, slowly add flour, then milk, flour, then milk, until all ingredients are mixed together. Pour batter into pans and bake until toothpick comes out clean.</p>

<p>I used two 9-inch round pans and baked them for 30 minutes. Let the cake cool completely before trying to remove from the pan.</p>

<p><strong>Coffee Frosting Ingredients:</strong></p>

<p>1 tbsp. instant coffee powder<br />
1 tbsp. hot water<br />
2 c. butter<br />
1 lb. powdered sugar<br />
1 tsp. vanilla extract</p>

<p><strong>Coffee Frosting Instructions:</strong></p>

<p>Combine instant coffee powder and water. Stir until powder is completely dissolved. Set aside. In a large bowl, mix butter on high until fluffy. Slowly add sugar, coffee mixture, and vanilla. Mix on low until smooth.</p>

<p>I ended up adding a second 1/2 batch of the coffee mixture to my icing (because I really like coffee), if you do this you must also add a little bit more powdered sugar or your icing will be too runny.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/06/mocha-frosted-chocolate-cake/cake-024/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/06/cake-024-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="slice" /></a><br />
<strong>Frosting Tips:</strong></p>

<p>1. Frost the top of the first layer, then stack the layers.<br />
2. Frost the top of the cake before moving to the sides.<br />
3. Allow the icing to firm in the fridge before adding toppings.</p>

<p>I hope your cake tastes as delicious as ours did. Happy baking!</p>

    <p>So, I like clothes…a lot. Although I usually default to jeans and a fitted T-shirt, my fashion tastes did evolve while working at Nordstrom before Jack and I got engaged. Nordstrom clothes+discount=hooked.</p>

<p>Nowadays, being a young married couple, there isn’t much shopping taking place. Instead, I look at clothes online and dream of flowing cotton dresses, classic cardigans, and modest heels.</p>

<p>Every now and then, I see a dainty dress and think, “I can make that, no problem.” Unfortunately, it usually turns out to be a problem. I tend to overestimate my sewing abilities and let my impatience get the best of me, usually resulting in a less-than-satisfactory end product.</p>

<p>This time however, the end product was a success and it really only took me 15 minutes.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/05/15-minute-dress/turkey-burger-and-dres-055/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/05/turkey-burger-and-dres-055-325x433.jpg" alt="" title="turkey burger and dres 055" /></a></p>

<p>I chose this olive/purple stretchy fabric, it’s like a rayon spandex blend of some sort. First, I took two pieces of the fabric and placed right sides together. Then, I set a dress, that I love, on top of the fabric (see below) and placed pins in the fabric around the dress to copy the shape.</p>

<p>Next, I sewed 4 inches across the top for the shoulders, not sewing all the way to the edge. Then I measured down about 6 inches (the dress I copied had wide arm holes) and started sewing from that point down to the bottom of the fabric following the line of pins. I got the idea for the simple sewing on the shoulders and sides from this <a href="http://treyandlucy.blogspot.com/2010/06/if-i-had-baby-girl.html">baby hankie dress</a> which explains the setup more precisely sorry forgot to take pictures of the setup).</p>

<p>Finally, I turned the dress inside out and added a cute belt and some matching shoes. Tada! A dress I can actually wear (excuse the headless pictures, it was late and I have no desire to have my picture taken). I still have to hem the bottom, but I wanted to get the pictures up. Want to try your hand at sewing an outfit? Trust me this is the simplest outfit ever ever. You CAN do this. Happy sewing!</p>

    <p>One of my favorite guilty pleasures growing up included a tub of peanut butter, a jar of jelly, and a spoon.  Yes, I realize this is ridiculously unhealthy but how can you resist? Luckily, my peanut butter cravings have diminished enough for my husband to not be completely disgusted by me, however these tiny treats take me back to my love affair with peanut butter.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/05/chocolate-covered-peanut-butter-balls/catering-051/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/05/Catering-051-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="Catering 051" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>

<p>1 lb. powdered sugar<br />
1/2 c. butter<br />
2 c. peanut butter (smooth or chunky)<br />
1 package of dipping chocolate (almond bark brand works well)</p>

<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>

<p>Blend peanut butter and butter with mixer. Add powdered sugar.<br />
If you use smooth peanut butter try adding corn flakes to the mix and taking out a little bit of powdered sugar. This gives you a more subtle crunch than you would get with crunchy peanut butter and it just happens to be my favorite way to eat peanut butter balls.</p>

<p>Shape dough into 1-1.5 inch balls and place on a cookie sheet.</p>

<p>Ok, this next step is IMPORTANT…once all the balls are rolled place the sheet in the fridge for at least 30 minutes. The peanut butter must be firm before coating with chocolate or they will fall apart.</p>

<p>Melt dipping chocolate in a double boiler. You can microwave if your chocolate allows but read the directions carefully.</p>

<p>I do not own a double boiler so instead, I put a glass bowl on top of a pot of boiling water to melt the chocolate. This works well, but be sure the two are a good fit. You want to avoid letting out steam that will get into your chocolate and cause bubbles.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/05/chocolate-covered-peanut-butter-balls/christmas-pics-048/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/05/Christmas-Pics-048-325x433.jpg" alt="" title="Christmas Pics 048" /></a></p>

<p>Next, drop a couple of peanut butter balls into the chocolate at a time, use two spoons to move the peanut butter balls around until coated. Carefully drop onto wax paper and let cool.</p>

<p>I know that seems like a lot of writing to explain this process but it’s really very simple, waiting to eat the finished product is the hardest part. Enjoy!</p>

    <p>I made these tasty pecan tarts this weekend, recipe courtesy of momma Mary, for the Chamber Youth Leadership graduation reception at Milligan. These mini tarts are quick and easy to make, not to mention they taste phenomenal. Great for any shower or large get-together.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/05/pecan-tarts/lots-of-projects-124/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/05/Lots-of-projects-124-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="Lots of projects 124" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Shell:</strong><br />
1/2 c. butter<br />
3 oz. cream cheese<br />
1 c. flour<br />
Pecan Filling:<br />
2 tbsp. butter<br />
3/4 c. brown sugar<br />
2 tsp. vanilla<br />
1 egg<br />
1 c. chopped pecans</p>

<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>

<p>Starting with the shell, blend butter and cream cheese. Once blended, add flour and mix. Dough will be crumbly.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/05/pecan-tarts/lots-of-projects-088/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/05/Lots-of-projects-088-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="Lots of projects 088" /></a></p>

<p>Mix dough into 1.5 inch balls and place each in muffin slots on a mini muffin pan.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/05/pecan-tarts/lots-of-projects-112/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/05/Lots-of-projects-112-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="Lots of projects 112" /></a></p>

<p>Use a mini-tart shaper to press down in the middle of the dough, pushing the dough up along the sides of the pan.</p>

<p>If you do not have a tart shaper, like me, use the end of another tool from your vast array of cooking utensils. I used the blunt end of a pizza cutter.</p>

<p>I also flattened out the edges of my dough, pressing them into the side of the pan so there would be more room for filling.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/05/pecan-tarts/lots-of-projects-097/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/05/Lots-of-projects-097-325x433.jpg" alt="" title="Lots of projects 097" /></a></p>

<p>Now to the filling…</p>

<p>Mix all filling ingredients except the pecans with a blender.</p>

<p>Once ingredients are combined, pour in 1 c. of chopped pecans and mix with a spoon.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/05/pecan-tarts/lots-of-projects-106/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/05/Lots-of-projects-106-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="Lots of projects 106" /></a></p>

<p>Now, fill your tart shells with the filling. Fill only to the top edge of the shell.</p>

<p>Bake at 350 degrees for 20 minutes and voila! Mini pecan pies.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/05/pecan-tarts/lots-of-projects-107/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/05/Lots-of-projects-107-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="Lots of projects 107" /></a></p>

<p><em>A few tips:</em></p>

<ol>
  <li>You do not need to grease or spray your muffin pan prior to filling with dough. The butter in the dough keeps it from sticking.</li>
  <li>If you have trouble getting the pies out of the pan, use a thin piece of cardboard or a thick piece of paper to slide along the edges and it will pop right out.</li>
  <li>Dust the end of your dough-pressing tool with flour to keep it from sticking.</li>
  <li>Although small, these are fairly rich so you really do not need to make them any bigger than mini-muffin size.</li>
</ol>

<p>Happy baking!</p>

    <p>We have officially entered my favorite time of year, that time of year when there are more than 2 veggies in the store that both look and taste fresh. Maybe it’s just me but I’m pretty sure our meals taste 500 times better in the spring.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/05/bruschetta-baguettes/mint-tacos-muffins-bruschetta-042/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/05/mint-tacos-muffins-bruschetta-042-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="mint tacos, muffins, bruschetta 042" /></a></p>

<p>With summer just around the corner, Jack and I have started phasing out our heavier meals in exchange for lighter, more fresh versions of our favorites. Monday’s meal was fantastic! I made broiled bruschetta baguettes. This one is a must for the Weinbender recipe box.</p>

<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>

<p>1 baguette<br />
1/2 large tomato<br />
1/4 c. onion<br />
1/4 c. cucumber<br />
feta cheese<br />
graded cheddar cheese<br />
3 garlic cloves (minced)<br />
lettuce or spinach leaves<br />
2 tbsp olive oil<br />
pepper<br />
salt<br />
oregano<br />
basil</p>

<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>

<p>Slice the baguette lengthwise, so you separate the top from the bottom. Brush olive oil lightly over the tops of the bread. Mince garlic cloves and spread evenly over baguette.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/05/bruschetta-baguettes/mint-tacos-muffins-bruschetta-020/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/05/mint-tacos-muffins-bruschetta-020-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="mint tacos, muffins, bruschetta 020" /></a></p>

<p>Chop tomatoes, onions, and cucumbers. Place veggies on baguette. Lightly sprinkle with cheddar cheese. Sprinkle all seasonings according to your individual tastes.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/05/bruschetta-baguettes/mint-tacos-muffins-bruschetta-030/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/05/mint-tacos-muffins-bruschetta-030-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="mint tacos, muffins, bruschetta 030" /></a></p>

<p>Place baguette slices under broiler for about 10 minutes. Be sure to check every few minutes to make sure it doesn’t burn.</p>

<p>Chop a few slices of spinach or lettuce. Pull baguette out of oven when edges are browned. Sprinkle with lettuce and feta cheese.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/05/bruschetta-baguettes/mint-tacos-muffins-bruschetta-037/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/05/mint-tacos-muffins-bruschetta-037-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="mint tacos, muffins, bruschetta 037" /></a></p>

<p>I hope you enjoy it as much as we did. Happy broiling!</p>

    <p>Yesterday at the farm we had a Mother’s Day workshop which is one of my absolute favorite workshops each year. Mother’s day falls at the best time of the year for Linda’s flowers. The flowers are incredibly fragrant and absolutely gorgeous.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/05/flowers-for-mom/garden-pasta-farm-043-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/05/garden-pasta-farm-043-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="garden, pasta, farm 043" /></a></p>

<p>Some of my all-time favorites that bloom around this time include: ranunculus (the rose-like flower above), baptisia (the yellow stalk-like flower above), peonies, mock orange (my favorite), rhododendrons, spirea, smoke bush, and much more.</p>

<p>So, in honor of Mother’s Day, (and because pictures of the farm are my mother’s favorite posts) I decided to post some pictures of the beautiful flowers that all you mothers deserve to be given.</p>

<p>Happy Mother’s Day!</p>

    <p>I absolutely love shrimp. I could eat shrimp every single day and never tire of it. So, the other night, I decided to experiment with a make-shift shrimp soup. I was pleasantly surprised with the result. This recipe will feed 4 individuals 1 cup apiece.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/05/vegetable-shrimp-soup/shrimp-soup-and-tornadoes-017/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/05/shrimp-soup-and-tornadoes-017-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="shrimp soup and tornadoes 017" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>

<p>30 deveined shrimp without tail<br />
1/4 c. tomato sauce<br />
2 tomatoes<br />
2 green onions<br />
1/4 of a large cucumber<br />
1/4 c. red onion<br />
1 avocado<br />
1 leek<br />
1 tbsp. fresh cilantro<br />
1-2 tbsp. lime juice<br />
2 tsp. lemon juice<br />
1 tsp. pepper<br />
1 tsp. salt<br />
2 tsp. garlic</p>

<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>

<p>Thaw, rinse and drain shrimp. Place in frying pan to cook. Season with salt, pepper, and garlic. Add 1 tsp. lemon juice. Cook 2-3 minutes on each side.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/05/vegetable-shrimp-soup/shrimp-soup-and-tornadoes-011/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/05/shrimp-soup-and-tornadoes-011-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="shrimp soup and tornadoes 011" /></a></p>

<p>Chop cucumber, tomato, leeks, and onions and place in a pot on low with a small amount of butter.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/05/vegetable-shrimp-soup/shrimp-soup-and-tornadoes-007/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/05/shrimp-soup-and-tornadoes-007-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="shrimp soup and tornadoes 007" /></a></p>

<p>Add tomato sauce, lime, lemon, cilantro, 1 tbsp. garlic, salt and pepper.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/05/vegetable-shrimp-soup/shrimp-soup-and-tornadoes-008/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/05/shrimp-soup-and-tornadoes-008-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="shrimp soup and tornadoes 008" /></a></p>

<p>Add cooked shrimp to soup. Let cook for 5 minutes. Add avocado and serve.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/05/vegetable-shrimp-soup/shrimp-soup-and-tornadoes-021/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/05/shrimp-soup-and-tornadoes-021-575x461.jpg" alt="" title="shrimp soup and tornadoes 021" /></a></p>

<p>I also think this meal would work well cold or over rice. Don’t let the recipe limit your imagination, feel free to add to or take away from the ingredients, especially seasonings. I try to provide a general idea of how much seasoning I use but I normally season to taste, so taste your food as you go to make sure you like the finished product. Happy cooking!</p>

    <p>Grilling is one of the things I most look forward to about summer and this past weekend was perfect grilling weather.</p>

<p>Growing up, dad was always our designated grill master. I’d like to think I learned a few things from him throughout the years. However, I had never tried to grill the sweet potatoes before this past Saturday.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/04/grilled-vegetables/easter-017/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/04/easter-017-325x433.jpg" alt="" title="easter 017" /></a></p>

<p>Prior to living in the south, I had never eaten a sweet potato. I suppose you could argue that I must have tried yams at Thanksgiving or something to that effect, but I am convinced it never happened.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/04/grilled-vegetables/easter-021/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/04/easter-021-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="easter 021" /></a></p>

<p>In Tennessee, everyone eats sweet potatoes, also known as yams (although there is a difference between the two). Apparently, this root vegetable is some sort of nutrient super food, outranking all other vegetables in nutritional value in a 1992 study by the Center for Science in the Public Interest.</p>

<p>Anyways, all that to say, this weekend, we grilled our sweet potatoes and they were fantastic. We also grilled baby asparagus and zucchini (my all-time favorite grilled veggie).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/04/grilled-vegetables/easter-016/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/04/easter-016-575x519.jpg" alt="" title="easter 016" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Our simple and tasty grilling tips:</strong></p>

<p>Using a brush, lightly coat veggies with olive oil. Sprinkle with garlic and pepper.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/04/grilled-vegetables/easter-012/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/04/easter-012-575x506.jpg" alt="" title="easter 012" /></a></p>

<p>Grill until tender.I know… it’s super complicated, but simple always turns out the best.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/04/grilled-vegetables/easter-020/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/04/easter-020-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="easter 020" /></a></p>

<p>Another method for the zucchini is to coat with Italian dressing instead of olive oil, then sprinkle with garlic. Delicious!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/04/grilled-vegetables/easter-022/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/04/easter-022-325x433.jpg" alt="" title="easter 022" /></a></p>

<p>Best of luck with your grilling days to come. May it bring you and yours closer together this summer.</p>

    <p>Took out my good ol’ Betty Crocker cookbook the other night and threw together a combination of recipes that were oh so tasty. One part pound cake. One part coconut glaze.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/04/amaretto-coconut-pound-cake/crafts-and-cake-073/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/04/crafts-and-cake-073-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="crafts and cake 073" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Pound Cake Ingredients:</strong></p>

<p>2 1/2 c. sugar<br />
1 c. butter<br />
2 tbsp amaretto (my substitute for vanilla)<br />
5 eggs<br />
1 tsp baking powder<br />
1/4 tsp salt<br />
1 c. evaporated milk<br />
1/4 c. coconut flakes (only if you are also making the coconut topping)</p>

<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>

<p>Heat oven to 350 degrees. Grease bundt cake pan with shortening. Beat sugar, butter, vanilla, and eggs with electric mixer on low for 30 seconds. Beat on high for 5 minutes.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/04/amaretto-coconut-pound-cake/crafts-and-cake-040/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/04/crafts-and-cake-040-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="crafts and cake 040" /></a></p>

<p>Mix flour, baking powder, and salt in a second bowl. Beat flour mixture into sugar mixture on low speed alternating with evaporated milk. Add coconut. Pour mixture into pan.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/04/amaretto-coconut-pound-cake/crafts-and-cake-050/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/04/crafts-and-cake-050-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="crafts and cake 050" /></a></p>

<p>Bake for 50 minutes, until toothpick comes out clean. Let cool. Sprinkle with powdered sugar.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/04/amaretto-coconut-pound-cake/crafts-and-cake-060/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/04/crafts-and-cake-060-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="crafts and cake 060" /></a></p>

<p>Or add a topping of choice, like this…</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/04/amaretto-coconut-pound-cake/crafts-and-cake-072/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/04/crafts-and-cake-072-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="crafts and cake 072" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Amaretto Coconut Glaze Ingredients:</strong></p>

<p>1 c. sugar<br />
1/2 c. butter<br />
1 c. evaporated milk<br />
1 tbsp amaretto (my substitute for vanilla)<br />
3 egg yolks<br />
1 1/3 c. coconut flakes</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/04/amaretto-coconut-pound-cake/crafts-and-cake-052/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/04/crafts-and-cake-052-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="crafts and cake 052" /></a></p>

<p>Mix all ingredients minus coconut in a saucepan. Cook over medium heat for about 14 minutes, until consistency is semi-thick (like pureed soup). Add coconut flakes. Remove from heat and let cool about 30 minutes. Stir occasionally until consistency is spreadable.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/04/amaretto-coconut-pound-cake/crafts-and-cake-081/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/04/crafts-and-cake-081-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="crafts and cake 081" /></a></p>

<p>Apply liberally to top of cake and enjoy!</p>

    <p>My mom (momma Tammy) makes the best spaghetti sauce of all time. Even with the recipe, somehow mine is never quite as good as hers. Personally, I think the key to this yummy sauce is using ground Italian sausage instead of hamburger meat. The sausage is SO much more flavorful.</p>

<p>Despite my inability to recreate this sauce exactly, I thought I would share the recipe in the hopes of you making a sauce that is just as tasty. I have adjusted some of the ingredients to make the serving size for two.</p>

<p>Normally, momma Tammy dishes the sauce over spiral rotini noodles. If you are going to use noodles, you must use this kind. I don’t know why but it makes the dish so much better. You can also try my style, over garlic bread.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/04/momma-tammys-spaghetti-sauce/misc/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/04/misc-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="misc" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>

<p>1 package ground Italian sausage<br />
1 can stewed tomatoes<br />
1 can tomato sauce<br />
1/2 can tomato paste<br />
1/2 green pepper<br />
5-7 mushrooms sliced<br />
1/2 red onion chopped<br />
2 tbsp garlic powder<br />
2 tbsp oregano<br />
1 tbsp Italian seasoning<br />
1 tbsp pepper<br />
1 tsp salt<br />
1 loaf french bread<br />
Olive oil</p>

<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>

<p>Set oven to broil. Spread a thin amount of olive oil and sprinkle garlic powder and oregano over tops of slices. Place in oven about 5 minutes before sauce is completed.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/04/momma-tammys-spaghetti-sauce/misc-1/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/04/misc-1-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="misc-1" /></a></p>

<p>Chop all ingredients. Place Italian sausage in frying pan with 1/2 tbsp of olive oil. Cook until browned.</p>

<p>Add onions, peppers, and seasonings to meat. Cook for 5 minutes. Add stewed tomatoes after draining excess juice. Add tomato sauce (I like to buy one with some flavors added). Let simmer for 25 minutes. Stir occasionally.</p>

<p>If the sauce looks watery, add 1/2 can of tomato paste (mine varies with the type of sauce I buy).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/04/momma-tammys-spaghetti-sauce/misc-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/04/misc-2-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="misc-2" /></a></p>

<p>Once you have allowed time for the flavors to mix together, pull the bread out of the oven add sauce and enjoy!</p>

<p>A few tips for making Momma Tammy’s spaghetti sauce…</p>

<ol>
  <li>The longer you let it sit on the stove, the better it tastes. One thing I always thought was excessive was the amount of oregano and garlic she added. YOU CAN NEVER HAVE ENOUGH! Every time she went to stir the sauce, she added more oregano and more garlic. Trust me, this is the key to a spectacularly flavorful sauce.</li>
  <li>Watch your bread. Our family is notorious for making a delicious meal and then forgetting our bread in the last 5 minutes. We almost always end up fanning the smoke alarms. A sure-fire way to ruin the finishing touches of a great meal.</li>
</ol>

<p>Good luck and happy cooking!</p>

    <p>“So, I saw these shoes…”</p>

<p>Those are 5 little words that my husband hopes to hear as little as possible yet rarely does. I am usually a very practical person, however, when I saw the shoes pictured below it was love at first sight.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/04/sequin-shirt/rice-and-fanciness-092/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/04/Rice-and-Fanciness-092-575x359.jpg" alt="" title="Rice and Fanciness 092" /></a></p>

<p>Now comes the sad part, 4 months later, I still haven’t worn them. Why not? First of all, the college life is full of backpacks and trekking across campus through the rain, not exactly conducive to 3-inch heels. Second, I can’t find a fancy-schmancy ruffle shirt to wear with them. So, I attempted to make one.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/04/sequin-shirt/rice-and-fanciness-116/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/04/Rice-and-Fanciness-116-575x259.jpg" alt="" title="Rice and Fanciness 116" /></a></p>

<p>The picture above is the finished product. I was originally not going to add the sequins at the bottom (pictured below) and just let it be ruffly but I preferred the extra sparkle.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/04/sequin-shirt/rice-and-fanciness-044/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/04/Rice-and-Fanciness-044-325x576.jpg" alt="" title="Rice and Fanciness 044" /></a></p>

<p>I used this old tank from The Limited.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/04/sequin-shirt/rice-and-fanciness-023/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/04/Rice-and-Fanciness-023-575x486.jpg" alt="" title="Rice and Fanciness 023" /></a></p>

<p>And cut 15 pieces of red fabric to fill the middle section of the tank.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/04/sequin-shirt/rice-and-fanciness-025/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/04/Rice-and-Fanciness-025-325x321.jpg" alt="" title="Rice and Fanciness 025" /></a></p>

<p>Next, I folded each of the red pieces in half, lined them up side by side, and sewed across the top. Then I stitched the bottom edge. After the scraps were secured, I pinned the sequin strip over the stitching and sewed over the top.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/04/sequin-shirt/rice-and-fanciness-121/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/04/Rice-and-Fanciness-121-575x294.jpg" alt="" title="Rice and Fanciness 121" /></a></p>

<p>Yay! A sparkly shirt to go with my fancy shoes.</p>

<p>Dressing up a shirt is simple. If you don’t feel comfortable messing with both fabric and sequins, try sewing just one strip of sequins across a neckline or add a few simple, straight, sequin stripes across an old T-shirt.</p>

<p>So, pull out your favorite pair of impractical shoes, throw on your newly bedazzled shirt, and have fun!</p>

    <p>While there are many aspects of our little apartment that we love, one downside to apartment-living is the “no painting” rule. A consequence of having no color on the walls, I am forced to craft more in order to brighten up the place. Oh shucks.</p>

<p>I was going through a junk box last year and came across a package of potpourri. At first I thought I would be typical and arrange the potpourri in a vase with a candle, always a nice touch. Instead, I came up with this potpourri art.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/04/potpourri-frames/potpourri-017/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/04/potpourri-017-325x243.jpg" alt="" title="potpourri 017" /></a></p>

<p>Our couch is dark green so the limey-green fabric in these frames contrasts well and helps the walls pop with color. Potpourri tends to be muted colors so I definitely suggest picking a bright and bold color for the backdrop.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/04/potpourri-frames/potpourri-010/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/04/potpourri-010-325x243.jpg" alt="" title="potpourri 010" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Materials:</strong></p>

<p>3-8×10 frames<br />
6-5×6 pieces of fabric<br />
1-package of potpourri<br />
Tape or Hot glue</p>

<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>

<p>Overlap the frame backing with two pieces of fabric making the frayed edge visible (this adds dimension). Pull the fabric tight and tape or glue the fabric around the edge of the backing.</p>

<p>Next, scatter various pieces of potpourri over the fabric. I found that randomly dropping the pieces worked out much better than planned disarray.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/04/potpourri-frames/bread-and-potpurri-043/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/04/bread-and-potpurri-043-325x243.jpg" alt="" title="bread and potpurri 043" /></a></p>

<p>Carefully place the glass and frame over the top of your potpourri. If you are very particular about your placing, you can always use hot glue to make sure the potpourri stays in place as you attach the frame.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/04/potpourri-frames/bread-and-potpurri-046/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/04/bread-and-potpurri-046-325x250.jpg" alt="" title="bread and potpurri 046" /></a></p>

<p>Voila! You now have a unique piece of colorful art for your walls. There are lots of other materials you can use for a project like this so, as always, BE CREATIVE!</p>

<p>This morning I dragged my lazy bones out of bed at 6:30 and drove over to Grandview Christian Church, to help Linda set up for a workshop of sorts. Linda was guest speaking/teaching on the topic of flower ministries.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/04/early-morning-flowers/flowers-and-salad-035-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/04/flowers-and-salad-035-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="flowers and salad 035" /></a></p>

<p>As the go-to-flower gal around Grandview, Linda is well known around church, which is how I came to work on the farm with her.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/04/early-morning-flowers/flowers-and-salad-036/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/04/flowers-and-salad-036-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="flowers and salad 036" /></a></p>

<p>She faithfully donates her beautiful arrangements to Grandview services every week for all to enjoy.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/04/early-morning-flowers/flowers-and-salad-045/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/04/flowers-and-salad-045-325x433.jpg" alt="" title="flowers and salad 045" /></a></p>

<p>Flowers are a wonderful way to get involved at your local church. Don’t grow cut flowers? That’s ok! You would be amazed at the variety of arrangements you can make with tree branches, grasses, and even weeds.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/04/early-morning-flowers/flowers-and-salad-013/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/04/flowers-and-salad-013-325x433.jpg" alt="" title="flowers and salad 013" /></a></p>

<p>The pictures I’ve included are just a few from this morning’s workshop and should demonstrate how simple starting your own flower ministry could be. Enjoy!</p>

    <p>Have you ever wandered down the art aisle of your favorite home decorating store and thought the images were overpriced and somewhat amateur? You think, a 6-year-old can paint a red circle in the center of a white canvas, right? I have spent many hours in these stores thinking I can paint this myself, and finally one day, I did.</p>

<p>Painting does not have to be a difficult or expensive endeavor. I firmly believe that almost anyone has the ability to make beautiful art for their home. The most difficult part of painting is learning to work with the paints. However, if the task of painting still seems daunting to you, I have another suggestion. Pastel Chalks.</p>

<p>Pastels are some of the first art forms I attempted when I was younger and I have recently come back around to using them.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/04/still-life-chalk-art/marys-gift/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/04/marys-gift-575x289.jpg" alt="" title="marys gift" /></a></p>

<p>For Christmas last year, I decided to craft some made-to-order art pieces for the women in our family. The picture above was made using a canvas, pastel chalks, and my fingers for blending.</p>

<p>This “painting” was created for Momma Mary (Jack’s mom). She has a shabby-chic look in her home and I thought the simplicity of the piece and the colors would match well.</p>

<p>I am fully convinced that anyone can make this still-life piece. The fruit shape can be accomplished free-hand style or by printing out a clip art fruit of choice. Simply print, trace, and fill in the shapes with your favorite color. Be sure to have a wet rag on hand to clean your fingers from time to time.</p>

<p>The pictures were very well received and are a great idea if you need an inexpensive yet thoughtful gift idea. Trust me, you can do this!</p>

    <p>With one month left of school I feel like I am crawling out of my skin with craft fever. I have been attempting to finish Avynlea’s knitted blanket for the past 2 months and this week I have finally made it about 1/3 of the way. I am now halfway through color number 3 which means I get to start over and finally have a pattern! Although the process is slow it feels so good to see progress.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/knitted-blanket-update/avynleas-blanket-002/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/Avynleas-Blanket-002-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="Avynlea's Blanket 002" /></a></p>

<p>So, here are some pictures of said progress. Maybe it will inspire those of you who also have half-finished projects lying around. You CAN do it! Perhaps slowly, like me, but slow and steady wins the race… at least that’s what I hear.</p>

<p>Here is a link to the <a href="http://thekitchencurtain.blogspot.com/2011/02/knitted-blanket-for-avynlea.html">original knitted blanket</a> post complete with instructions.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/knitted-blanket-update/avynleas-blanket-005/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/Avynleas-Blanket-005-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="Avynlea's Blanket 005" /></a></p>

<p>Best of luck as you finish those pesky projects that never seem to end. I’ll be sure to keep you apprised on Avy’s blankie.</p>

    <p>Spring is here! After having almost an entire week of beautiful sun, we had one of the first big thunderstorms of spring last night.<br />
When we first moved to Tennessee, I never thought I would get used to the crashing thunder and giant bolts of lightning. Now, I love hearing the sound of heavy raindrops falling on the roof or slamming up against our glass door as the wind whips them every which way. It is soothing to listen to the rain and humbling to think about its mighty power.</p>

<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-fmPP7imBmTM/TYtDABgPmqI/AAAAAAAAAQE/kRnsFJArmpM/s1600/crafty%2B014.JPG"><br />
</a></p>

<p>In honor of what the beautiful sun and mighty rains bring to us each year (FLOWERS!), I thought I would post some simple arrangements thrown together at the farm in hopes of igniting creativity with your flowers at home.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/arrangements-from-the-garden/crafty-014-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/crafty-014-325x433.jpg" alt="" title="crafty 014" /></a></p>

<p>These arrangements are so simple. Grab one main flower and throw in leaves, grasses, ferns, anything you can find popping up in your backyard or even along the side of the road.</p>

<p>I love color so picking one or two main flowers that are bright and contrasting is my go-to plan. Hosta leaves, honeysuckle vines, grasses, and ferns are great fillers that you can find just about anywhere.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/arrangements-from-the-garden/img_0401-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/IMG_0401-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="IMG_0401" /></a></p>

<p>When in doubt, go simple. If you have lots of one beautiful flower, like this next picture, simply throw them all in a plain vase or pitcher to make the flowers stand out.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/arrangements-from-the-garden/flowers-041-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/flowers-041-325x433.jpg" alt="" title="flowers 041" /></a></p>

<p>Don’t worry about making your arrangements perfect and static like FTD. Fun, loose, and wild is the way to go… at least with flowers.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/arrangements-from-the-garden/crafty-011-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/crafty-011-325x433.jpg" alt="" title="crafty 011" /></a></p>

<p>Peonies are a beautiful and full flower. They are abundant around Mother’s Day and make arranging easy and quick. Below is a simple arrangement with only peonies and dianthus.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/arrangements-from-the-garden/flowers-007/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/flowers-007-325x433.jpg" alt="" title="flowers 007" /></a></p>

<p>And of course, daffodils are the perfect spring flower. These bright beauties are perfect by themselves. If you decide to combine them with another plant like forsythia (which is blooming everywhere here in T-town), be sure to wash the stems to get rid of their sap. It is not friendly to other plants.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/arrangements-from-the-garden/flowers-090-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/flowers-090-325x460.jpg" alt="" title="flowers 090" /></a></p>

<p>I hope these pictures have sparked some ideas. Now, go take a walk and explore the wide variety of spring plants and shrubs that will add the perfect flair to your arrangements. Be creative. Good luck and happy spring!</p>

    <p>As if baby clothes weren’t cute enough, last night I attempted to spruce up my <a href="http://thekitchencurtain.blogspot.com/2011/03/baby-skirt.html">original baby skirt pattern</a> with a few simple additions and I love how it turned out! I mean, basically everything is cuter small, but adding little ruffles…who can resist?!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/tiered-baby-skirt/baby-skirt-030/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/baby-Skirt-030-325x433.jpg" alt="" title="baby Skirt 030" /></a></p>

<p>This is very simple and if you are anything like me, you will feel so accomplished when it is complete.</p>

<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>

<p>Most of the piecing together follows the directions for the <a href="http://thekitchencurtain.blogspot.com/2011/03/baby-skirt.html">original baby skirt</a> I made a few posts back. Start by hemming the bottom edge of your main fabric pieces (the front and back).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/tiered-baby-skirt/baby-skirt-001/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/baby-Skirt-001-325x433.jpg" alt="" title="baby Skirt 001" /></a></p>

<p>Before you sew the front and back pieces together, cut 3-5 pieces of the same fabric (how many depends on how much you want them to overlap) that are the same length across as the front of the skirt (11in) and 3in. wide.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/tiered-baby-skirt/baby-skirt-005/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/baby-Skirt-005-325x433.jpg" alt="" title="baby Skirt 005" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Fabric Measurements:</strong></p>

<p>2-11×16 outer fabric<br />
2-11×16 lining<br />
3 or 5-11×3 outer fabric</p>

<p>I chose not to put the lining in this skirt but feel free to include in yours.</p>

<p>Next, hem the 11×3 pieces of fabric lengthwise on one side only (this will be the bottom of your ruffle).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/tiered-baby-skirt/baby-skirt-006/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/baby-Skirt-006-325x433.jpg" alt="" title="baby Skirt 006" /></a></p>

<p>After all the hems are sewn, align and pin these scraps to the front of the skirt. Place the fabrics with right sides touching and with the bottom-hem side at the top (essentially upside down).</p>

<p>Pin the 3in. pieces to the skirt starting at the skirt waist. Overlap the first ruffle by 1-1.5 inches and continue with each subsequent piece.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/tiered-baby-skirt/baby-skirt-012/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/baby-Skirt-012-325x433.jpg" alt="" title="baby Skirt 012" /></a></p>

<p>Sew the non-hemmed edge across the front of the skirt. Start with the bottom ruffle and work your way up. After each strip is sewn, remove pins and fold fabric over the seam so the seam is hidden underneath.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/tiered-baby-skirt/baby-skirt-017/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/baby-Skirt-017-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="baby Skirt 017" /></a></p>

<p>Once you have flipped each piece of fabric over onto itself, iron them down. You should have a piece of fabric that looks something like this…</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/tiered-baby-skirt/baby-skirt-023/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/baby-Skirt-023-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="baby Skirt 023" /></a></p>

<p>After all scraps are sewn to the front of the skirt, measure 1in. from each edge and sew vertically down the entire skirt, over the top of all of your scraps. Forgot to get a picture of this before piecing it all together. You can kinda see the seam lines on the picture below however.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/tiered-baby-skirt/baby-skirt-029/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/baby-Skirt-029-325x433.jpg" alt="" title="baby Skirt 029" /></a></p>

<p>The rest, pretty much follows the original tutorial. You’ll need to sew the front and back of the skirt with right sides facing each other, then fold over the top to make a pocket to feed the elastic through, and finally secure your elastic.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/tiered-baby-skirt/baby-skirt-030/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/baby-Skirt-030-325x433.jpg" alt="" title="baby Skirt 030" /></a></p>

<p>And voila! A cute tiered baby skirt to spruce up baby’s wardrobe. I used the same fabric and appliqued a circle on a plain white onesie to make the outfit complete. With this basic idea you can go crazy with creativity and ruffle all sorts of old clothes. Good luck and happy sewing!</p>

    <p>You know that feeling you get when you purchase the perfect pair of jeans and all you want to do is put them on and strut your stuff? Unfortunately, the jeans are way too long and you want to wear them now! This is a common issue in our household seeing as I am obsessed with jeans, have short legs, and am extremely impatient.</p>

<p>I used to think jeans were so difficult to hem and I never liked them quite as much after hemming because they no longer had the original stitching.</p>

<p>Then I discovered an easy way to keep your old hem without cutting off tons of fabric and possibly ruining your brand new pair of jeans. The original tutorial can be found <a href="http://sketchee.com/blog/2008/7/8/hemming-jeans-like-a-pro.html">here</a>. For someone like me who tends to have to sew things twice to get it right, this is a great technique.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/how-to-hem-jeans/hem-001/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/hem-001-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="hem 001" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>

<p>First, put on those fabulous jeans and decide how much material you need to remove. I love this hemming method because you don’t have to spend an hour pinning and re-pinning to make each cuff match the other. Just measure the excess.</p>

<p>Next, cut that measurement in half. If you need to take off 2 inches, now you are going off of a 1 inch measurement.</p>

<p>Now, make a cuff and measure this amount (the 1 inch) from the original hem edge, not the end of the jeans. Measure and pin all the way around your new cuff.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/how-to-hem-jeans/hem-002/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/hem-002-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="hem 002" /></a></p>

<p>Stitch along the edge of the original hem. The sides can get tricky. I always start on the outside seam, the one that shows the jean thread. This ensures that when you flip the pant leg right-side-out, the threads that stand out will align all the way down the leg.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/how-to-hem-jeans/hem-005/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/hem-005-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="hem 005" /></a></p>

<p>Flip the material inside the leg. Iron the new hem down and presto, shorter pants, same old hem. (If having the excess on the inside bothers you, simply cut it off.)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/how-to-hem-jeans/hem-007/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/hem-007-325x433.jpg" alt="" title="hem 007" /></a></p>

<p>I’ve included a picture of a wide hem as well. I find this hemming technique works best with wide hemmed jeans. It can be a bit trickier with the normal thin hems like the one above.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/how-to-hem-jeans/hem-009/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/hem-009-325x433.jpg" alt="" title="hem 009" /></a></p>

<p>Estimated hem time is about 10 minutes so you can be in your jeans and feelin’ good in no time. Good luck and happy hemming!</p>

    <p>While Jack and I absolutely love our little Tennessee home, living in an apartment has certain disadvantages. Aside from the constant din of teenage neighbor girls bickering over a borrowed sweater, we have no land to garden!</p>

<p>Some might consider this a blessing, never having to mow the lawn or weed the garden, but me, I crave the dirt. There are few things that compare to being outside with the sun on your shoulders and your hands in the ground.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/diy-planter-box/flowers-075/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/flowers-075-325x433.jpg" alt="" title="flowers 075" /></a></p>

<p>Last summer, Jack and I were surprised to find a ridiculous amount of planting pots available in stores but a severe lack of planting boxes, at least ones that didn’t jump into the hundreds of dollars range. All I wanted was to plant some veggies on our porch and pretend we had our own secret garden.</p>

<p>My dear husband, always willing to help with my ill-planned schemes, devised this simple box to show off my veggies. Did we research how to best go about this task? No, of course not, that would be silly right? Well, the plan worked, mostly. (I’ll get to the “what we learned” section at the end.)</p>

<p>We went to our local Home Depot and figured out the cheapest way to build the planter box, ended up being about $25. We bought two pine boards and had them cut into the following measurements:</p>

<p><strong>Measurements:</strong></p>

<p>1-10ft 1×12<br />
1-3ft 2×2<br />
Cutting Directions<br />
Cut 1×12 into 2-1ft sections and 2-4ft sections<br />
Cut 2×2 into 3-1ft sections<br />
Other Materials<br />
Screen door mesh (or some other screening with tiny holes)<br />
Screws</p>

<p>Build a Planter Box</p>

<p>Hopefully, the cutting makes sense. Next is simply a matter of piecing all the boards together. Obviously, your shorter boards are your ends and the longer, your sides. Assemble the pieces using screws (We used nails, but don’t do it. More on this later.)</p>

<p>After the four main boards are nailed together, attach the netting to the bottom of the box. This will help drain water, without draining dirt as well.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/diy-planter-box/img_0240/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/IMG_0240-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="IMG_0240" /></a></p>

<p>Next, attach the 2×2 blocks over the top of the netting, one toward each end and one in the middle. We did this mostly to keep it up off of the porch so there would be no rotting underneath from the drainage.<br />
Flip it over and you have a box for planting in!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/diy-planter-box/img_0247/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/IMG_0247-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="IMG_0247" /></a></p>

<p>Now, a couple things to think about and adjust.Our box worked wonderfully for the summer but had a few issues as we neared the end of growing season.</p>

<p>We used nails to piece our boards together, but with dirt and the expanding roots, eventually the pressure inside the box started to push out the nails and the boards began to separate.</p>

<p><strong>Suggestion #1:</strong> use screws, not nails</p>

<p>Also, in Tennessee we have quite a few thunderstorms throughout the summer and the wood took a bit of a beating.</p>

<p><strong>Suggestion #2:</strong> try using a different type of wood, one that is more hardy, or try treating it with some sort of outdoor weather sealer<br />
I think that about covers it all. I think this year we are going to try to make smaller individuals boxes instead of the long one and maybe paint them to add more color to the porch! Best of luck and happy growing!</p>

    <p>Seeing as it is my spring break, I have decided to celebrate this week by working on all the fun little projects I have been dying to try for my new niece. Today’s project, skirts!</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I have no babies or dolls to get a good picture of the skirt, but trust me it’s adorable and the pictures don’t do it justice.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/baby-skirt/crafty-016/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/crafty-016-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="crafty 016" /></a></p>

<p>This skirt took me about 30 minutes to complete. All I did was cut two 11×16 pieces of one fabric (the pink) and two 11×16 pieces of cream for the lining. Start by sewing the two pink pieces together (along the 11in sides), right sides facing each other. Same with the inner lining. Then, with the two sets still inside out, slip the lining around the outside of the outside piece and line up your seams.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/baby-skirt/crafty-017/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/crafty-017-325x449.jpg" alt="" title="crafty 017" /></a></p>

<p>Next, grab both layers and fold over 1/2 in. at the top of the skirt and sew along the cut edge leaving a pocket to slip elastic through later on. The hem the two layers separately. I suggest hemming the lining at 1/2 inch and the outer layer at 1/4 in.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/baby-skirt/crafty-018/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/crafty-018-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="crafty 018" /></a></p>

<p>Last of all, cut a small slit through the top folded edge (be sure to go through both layers on the inside but not to cut all the way through the front of the skirt). Next, attach a 1/8 in. elastic strip to the end of a pencil (I used a pin) and slide it through the hole and all the way around the skirt. Once you have two ends of the elastic pull so it is snug and sew over the two pieces to secure.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/baby-skirt/crafty-019/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/crafty-019-325x433.jpg" alt="" title="crafty 019" /></a></p>

<p>Very very simple to make. I’m sure you could all figure these out on your own but hopefully, this will help get your creative juices flowing. I have 4 more fabrics that I am using to make these this week so I’m sure you’ll be seeing more pictures very soon. Happy sewing!</p>

    <p>I had an itch to sew today and decided to give these baby shoes a try. The pattern is simple to follow and can be found <a href="http://www.michaelmillerfabrics.com/blog/cloth_shoe.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/baby-shoes/crafty-010/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/crafty-010-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="crafty 010" /></a></p>

<p>I had a few issues getting equal tension on each foot, but I am pretty pleased at my first attempt. Looking forward to trying some different patterns. Baby Avynlea will have the coolest shoes on the block!</p>

    <p>I am one of those individuals who collects pretty much everything I have ever received. You might say I am overly-sentimental. I like to think I simply have incredible insight to possible future uses of said gifts. I mean, you never know when a ceramic lime green elephant will come in handy.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/spring-petal-mosaic/img_0088/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/IMG_0088-325x397.jpg" alt="" title="IMG_0088" /></a></p>

<p>One of the items I have acquired many of over the years are roses. I have dried roses from high school plays, Valentine’s days, and birthdays in jars all around my home. Well, last March, spring cleaning got the best of me and I decided to get rid of the clutter of jars. Of course, I couldn’t bring myself to throw away the entire collection of dried petals so I came up with a way to display the flowers in a more condensed manner.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/spring-petal-mosaic/img_0096/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/IMG_0096-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="IMG_0096" /></a></p>

<p>I took a canvas and painted the sides and background in varying shades of green. Painting the background made it easier to attach the petals without having to worry about covering every tiny hole. After the canvas dried I took craft glue and started attaching different shades of petals in groupings and then blending the groups together with a gradient of petals. I also added a few dried leaves to help make the green underneath blend well with the overall composition.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/spring-petal-mosaic/img_0091/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/IMG_0091-325x433.jpg" alt="" title="IMG_0091" /></a></p>

<p>I couldn’t be happier with how the piece turned out. I now have my own unique piece of spring art that ties together our flowered curtains and green couch in the living room.</p>

<p>I’ve been working on this blanket for my soon-to-be niece, Avynlea. Her mommy asked for pink to match the room. I ended up with 2 shades of pink that are girly but not necessarily little girl, girly. I like to think these colors are a bit sophisticated as well.</p>

<p>I chose Loops &amp; Threads brand Country Loom thread. I love this thread because it is a little fluffy so it hides mistakes well. My colors are (from right to left below), Rodeo, Warm Cream, and Snapdragon. Snapdragon is my favorite!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/02/knitted-blanket-for-avynlea/img_0086/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/02/IMG_0086-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="IMG_0086" /></a></p>

<p>I like to knit while doing other things (watching Biggest Loser)so I decided not to count rows because I know I’ll get distracted. Instead I am knitting one whole ball of yarn (104 yards/95m) for each pink color (ends up being 16 whole rows-32 single rows) and separating them with 8 whole (whole=”down and back”) rows of cream. Another great striped blanket pattern can be found <a href="http://www.purlbee.com/the-purl-bee/2010/10/17/purl-soho-kit-the-super-easy-baby-blanket.html">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Blanket:</strong></p>

<p><em>Stitch</em>: garter (knit every row)<br />
<em>Yarn</em>: 4 snapdragon, 2 rodeo, 2 cream<br />
<em>No. of Stitches</em>: 115<br />
<em>Needle Size</em>: 9-10mm (mine is 9 wish I would have done a 10)</p>

<p>The Doans run a specialty cut-flower farm called <em>Aunt Willie’s Wildflowers</em>. Linda spends most of the spring and summer growing cut flowers for farmer’s markets. She also teaches various flower arranging workshops and arranges flowers for weddings. Her workshops feature a variety of creative arrangements–from teapots to stumps, you name it, she can arrange in it. Check out Linda’s website <a href="http://auntwillieswildflowers.com/">Aunt Willie’s Wildflowers</a>.</p>

<p>Linda used this centerpiece for one of the workshops last spring and I, of course, fell in love with the idea. All she did was take an old chicken feeder, fill it with soil &amp; plant multiple lettuce varieties. The centerpiece at the workshop lunch was this feeder and the ladies were able to pick leaves of lettuce to add to their salads.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/02/chicken-feeder-centerpiece/chickenfeederlettuce-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/02/chickenfeederlettuce-2-575x431.jpg" alt="chicken feeder lettuce" title="chickenfeederlettuce (2)" /></a></p>

<p>For any of you looking to bring a bit of country to your next get together, I highly recommend giving this a try.</p>

    <p>I made these diaper bags for a friend and also for my sister-in-law when we heard the big news. The bags are very very simple to make and require little sewing expertise, which is perfect for me.</p>

<p><img src="{{page.assets}}diaper-bag-1.jpg" alt="Diaper Bag" /></p>

<p>The pattern is available at <a href="http://www.makebabystuff.com/">www.makebabystuff.com.</a> The website has a printable pattern making it easy to place right on top of your fabric and cut the right proportions. They have lots of other neat patterns as well but this is my favorite.</p>

<p><img src="{{page.assets}}diaper-bag-2.jpg" alt="Diaper Bag" /></p>

<p>I loved this pattern and instructions because once you’ve completed one bag you can play around with the dimensions of your paper pattern to make pretty much any shape/type of bag you want using the same instructions (will post pictures of some of my favorites later).</p>

<p><img src="{{page.assets}}diaper-bag-3.jpg" alt="Diaper Bag" /></p>

<p>I have listed the materials below so you can quickly see how little is required for this project. Full instructions and pattern can be found <a href="http://www.make-baby-stuff.com/free-diaper-bag-pattern.html">here</a>.</p>

<p><img src="{{page.assets}}diaper-bag-4.jpg" alt="Diaper Bag" /></p>

<p><strong>Materials:</strong></p>

<p>1.5 yards canvas or other sturdy fabric
1.5 yards lining fabric
1/2 yard patterned fabric
magnetic snap, 7″ zipper &amp; velcro
interfacing (optional)
pins, scissors, sewing machine, etc</p>

    <p>Hello friends. Let’s jump right into our third month of freezer meal schedules, grocery list and tools for planning (if you haven’t read <a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/10/freezer-meal-schedule-and-planning-2/">Freezer Meal Schedule &amp; Planning: Month #2</a>, check it out first). Our schedule for month #3 worked out to be even better than the month before. This is getting easier and easier each month because we always have a few meals leftover so I don’t have to add as many new recipes to the mix and yet we still have much variety to work with.</p>

<p>Here is the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ApU9WwQlN06CdG5HY2k5V3JyaFhMS3BGS3BsQVFuUVE">link</a> to our shopping list for this month. Our total store amount added up to $93.10. We decided we would allow an extra trip for milk each month since our freezer isn’t big enough to buy 2 gallons and freeze one. So our extra expenses for this month added up to $18 with one extra carton of eggs, milk and produce.</p>

<p>See our <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ApU9WwQlN06CdGNiajNBR2o1emV0N1JlSDNmLUZlcVE">month #3 meal schedule</a>.</p>

<p><em>Monthly Meals:</em></p>

<p><strong>Dinner:</strong></p>

<p>Chili over rice–leftover from last month (2 meals for 2)<br />
Curried Carrot Soup–leftover from last month (new batch-8 meals for 2)<br />

Spaghetti (5 meals for 2)<br />
Baked Potatoes (5 lb bag, about 8 meals for 2)</p>

<p><strong>Sides:</strong></p>

<p>Oriental Chicken Salad<br />
Homemade Cornbread<br />
Rice</p>

<p><strong>Lunches:</strong></p>

<p>PB&amp;J<br />
Tuna<br />
Small Baked Potatoes</p>

<p><strong>Snacks:</strong></p>

<p>Bananas<br />
Apples<br />
Yogurt<br />
Grapes</p>

<p><strong>Sweet Sloppy Joe Chicken:</strong></p>

<p>I used the same <a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/10/freezer-meal-schedule-and-planning-2/#sweet-sloppy">sweet &amp; sloppy joe chicken recipe</a> as last month but we decided to use a rotisserie chicken at Ingles since they were on sale for $4.89 instead of chicken breasts. The rotisserie chicken proved to be a bit less expensive and yielded the same amount of chicken as the chicken breasts. Click link above to see recipe at “Freezer Meal Schedule &amp; Planning: Month #2″ post.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/09/lower-your-grocery-bill-monthly-meals-part-2/#carrot-soup" title="Lower Your Grocery Bill &amp; Monthly Meals (Part 2)">Curried Carrot Soup:</a></strong></p>

<p>I cooked up a double portion of our curried carrot soup this month because, well, it’s delicious! Click the link above to see our recipe.</p>

<p><strong>Taquitos:</strong></p>

<p>Since I used the last of the shredded beef in last month’s taquitos, I decided to go for simple rice and bean taquitos this month. We used brown rice, kidney beans, green onions, cilantro and a bit of cheddar cheese to fill the tortillas along with a sprinkling of adobe powder and pepper.</p>

<p>We bought a 40-pack of small flour tortillas, which were $.05 cheaper/unit than smaller amount packages.</p>

<p><strong>Hawaiian Chicken &amp; Carrot Slaw:</strong></p>

<p>We bought our usual large package of chicken breasts and a bottle of Hawaiian marinade. When we get home from the store, we always cut the chicken into 8 oz portions (4 oz = 1 single serving). This makes it easy to quickly thaw a bag for dinner. You can choose to marinade the chicken before freezing or after it thaws.</p>

<p>Warm up your pan and get your chicken cooking. Now peel one large carrot with a potato peeler. Then chop your shavings into smaller pieces and combine in a bowl with chopped sweet onion, a dash of pepper and garlic, 1 tsp balsamic vinegar and a dash of red wine vinegar. Combine, chicken, carrot slaw, and rice in your tortillas and enjoy!</p>

<p>I love this recipe, it tastes very light, flavorful and fresh. We used the leftover tortillas from our 40-pack that was bought for taquitos. Ours lasted all month long but they freeze well too if you are worried about them staying fresh.</p>

<p><strong>Spaghetti:</strong></p>

<p>Kielbasa was on sale this month so we changed up our usual spaghetti recipe (which uses ground sausage) and substituted kielbasa. Yummy! I purchased some pasta noodles, diced tomatoes and tomato paste last month when it was on sale so I thought I should use up those items this month. Of course, I recommend sticking with what you know best and use your favorite spaghetti recipe. Divide the sauce into meal-sized baggies to freeze and when you’re ready for spaghetti, just thaw your sauce and cook up the noodles. My recipe yielded 12 cups of sauce.</p>

<p><strong>Cornbread:</strong></p>

<p>Simple and quick <a href="http://allrecipes.com/recipe/golden-sweet-cornbread/detail.aspx">golden sweet cornbread recipe from all recipes</a>. We poured our batter into muffin pans, which left us with 12 large cornbread muffins.</p>

<p><strong>Snacks:</strong></p>

<p>For our snacks this month, we tried to eat the bananas first, as they expire more quickly, the apples last us pretty much all month long. Yogurt Jack can space out with his lunches for about 3 weeks. The grapes, we separated into individual baggies and froze to be eaten later. They taste just as wonderful when you pull them back out.</p>

    <p>Hello Friends! I have two months of freezer meals, schedules and recipes to share with you today. You can link directly to <a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/10/freezer-meal-schedule-and-planning/">Freezer Meal Schedule &amp; Planning: Month #3</a> here.</p>

<p>Our second month of once-a-month-shopping and freezer meals was a little haphazard due to my lack of diligent planning on the front-end with meals, however, we made it through the month with only one extra trip to the store for a special dinner we hosted for a couple of friends. At the end of <a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/09/lower-your-grocery-bill-monthly-meals-part-2/" title="Lower Your Grocery Bill &amp; Monthly Meals (Part 2)">Freezer Meals: Month #1</a> we still had about six burger meals leftover, four carrot soups, and five servings of chili. Those meals were then incorporated into the next month’s meal schedule.</p>

<p>Here is a link to my groceries for <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ApU9WwQlN06CdEZKaVpkeGk4UGVhamJCRTBKOFZEdEE">month #2</a>. I only included the food groceries for a general guideline and left off the detergents, lunch baggies, etc. There weren’t as many BOGO deals at Ingles this month but I took advantage of some of their discounts on chicken broth, kitchen bags and tomato sauces for the following month. Our total grocery store trip (between two stores) cost $102.47. Throughout the month, we also spent $12 more at the produce stand down the street.</p>

<p><em>Month #2 Meals:</em></p>

<p><strong>Dinner:</strong><br />
Chili over rice–leftover from last month (5 meals for 2)<br />
Curried Carrot Soup–leftover from last month (4 meals for 2)<br />
BLT Sandwiches<br />
Burgers–leftover (4 meals for 2)<br />
Sloppy Joe Chicken Sandwiches (5 meals)<br />
Taquitos (24 individual-6 meals)<br />
Potato Corn Chowder (5 meals)</p>

<p><strong>Sides:</strong><br />
Oriental Salad<br />
Roasted Red Potatoes<br />
<a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/08/homemade-dinner-rolls/">Homemade Dinner Rolls</a></p>

<p><strong>Lunches:</strong><br />
PB&amp;J<br />
Cheese Sandwiches<br />
Tuna<br />
Rice and Beans</p>

<p><strong>Breakfast:</strong><br />
Toast &amp; Jam<br />
Eggs<br />
French Toast<br />
Oatmeal</p>

<p><strong>Snacks:</strong></p>

<p>Bananas<br />
Apples<br />
yogurt</p>

<p>Check out our <a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/09/lower-your-grocery-bill-monthly-meals-part-2/">first month of freezer meals</a> for recipes that were re-made or leftover (carrot soup, roasted red potatoes, homemade dinner rolls, Chili)</p>

<p><strong>Grilled Corn and Potato Chowder:</strong></p>

<p>Since the weather was starting to cool down a bit, we decided to make another soup, and this time a bit heartier one. We chose this <a href="http://www.myrecipes.com/recipe/grilled-corn-potato-chowder-10000001918508/">grilled corn and potato chowder</a> from MyRecipes–it is awesome! I was a bit skeptical, especially as I was making a corn paste with our food processor, but it is really a treat. We ended up adding in more of the corn paste, because it added such a good flavor, and a bit more milk (1%). I did not use fresh thyme, just the ol’ dried stuff, and instead of actual corn ears, I used canned (cause it’s what I had) and grilled it with salt and red pepper before throwing into the food processor.</p>

<p><strong>Taquitos:</strong></p>

<p>We also bought a package of those mini flour tortillas, great for making taquitos. I pulled out my last bag of plain shredded beef from a roast we made last year and placed rice, beans onion, and the shredded beef into the tortillas, rolled them and lined them up in a casserole dish to freeze. Every time we wanted taquitos, we simply pulled out the dish, broke off four taquitos and baked them in the oven for about 35 minutes. We typically ate these with a side of rice and a salad. I used about 3 cups of shredded beef and 3 cups of rice and 2 cup of beans to make 24 taquitos (we adjusted this for the next month if you don’t want to use the meat).</p>

<p>Our last addition to month #2 of freezer meals was an experiment by me for sloppy joe chicken. I love normal sloppy joes, minus the grease and I wanted to at least pretend I was making a slightly healthier version by using chicken (we really like our chicken). I basically just started throwing things together to see what I could come up with and this sweet &amp; sloppy sauce hits the spot every time. Seriously, it’s our favorite meal now, and yes, we continued it into the next month.</p>

<p><a id="sweet-sloppy"></a><strong>Sweet &amp; Sloppy Joe Chicken:</strong></p>

<p>4 large chicken breasts<br />
2 cups ketchup<br />
2 tbsp Worchsetershire<br />
2 tbsp balsamic vinegar<br />
1 tbsp red wine vinegar<br />
3 tbsp brown sugar<br />
1 tsp ground mustard<br />
1 tsp pepper<br />
2 tsp garlic powder<br />
salt</p>

<p>Since it was our first attempt at this sauce we started off with a small batch and only used four large chicken breasts (the next month we tried it with one rotisserie chicken from the store ($4 and same amount of meals). Put the chicken in the crockpot, let it cook through, add the rest of the ingredients, allow to cook on low in the crockpot for one hour. Voila, sweet and sloppy chicken. We toasted wheat hamburger buns and piled on the sloppy joe chicken.</p>

    <p>I hope you enjoyed <a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/09/lower-your-grocery-bill-monthly-shopping-part-1/">Lowering Your Grocery Bill Part 1</a> of tips to lowering your grocery bill and preparing monthly meals. Today I am going to show you a sample meal plan with various recipes.</p>

<p>I mentioned in our first post that you should prepare your meals on a different day than your shopping day. We shop on Friday evenings when people are out painting the town red, this allows us to come home, put away groceries, soak beans, relax and then start fresh on Saturday morning. Prior to preparing your meals look at all of your recipes to consolidate prep time. If more than one recipe requires onions, then by all means, chop all of the onions at the same time. Trust me, this will save you oodles of time. Also, look for alternate cooking methods–if you have two items that can be baked at the same temp, prepare them first, put them in together, and move on to the next meal while they cook. You can also throw lots and lots of meals in a crockpot (chili!) while others are cooking in the oven.</p>

<p><strong>Month #1</strong></p>

<p><em>Dinners:</em><br />
Roasted Red Potatoes, sauteed onions &amp; salad<br />
Chili over rice (don’t knock it til you’ve tried it)<br />
Curried Carrot Soup<br />
Grilled Eggplant Tomato Aioli Sandwiches<br />
Grilled Chicken Salad<br />
Chicken and Rice (with a variety of marinades &amp; seasonings)<br />
Burgers<br />
Jerk Chicken Sandwiches<br />
Frittatas</p>

<p><em>Sides:</em><br />
Salad with tomatoes, cucumbers, onion, pine nuts<br />
Grilled Zucchini or zucchini salad<br />
Red potatoes (smaller portion than the dinner potatoes)<br />
dinner rolls<br />
corn on the cob</p>

<p><em>Lunches:</em><br />
PB&amp;J<br />
Tuna Sandwiches<br />
Our favorite Rice and Beans with salad<br />
yogurt<br />
granola</p>

<p><em>Breakfast:</em><br />
Toast<br />
Eggs<br />
Homemade granola</p>

<p>Here are some of the recipes I used and the ways I’ve adapted them to keep costs low. Although the recipes are simple you can mix them up quite a bit with different seasonings and by mixing up the paired sides. Also, most of my seasoning is done by taste and I am not shy at all with adding seasonings especially when it comes to garlic and curry so be generous, I’ll try to keep track of my amounts when these items come back into our rotation.</p>

<p><strong>Dinners:</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/09/lower-your-grocery-bill-monthly-meals-part-2/freezer-meals-monthly-shopping-7-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/09/freezer-meals-monthly-shopping-71-325x216.jpg" alt="carrot soup" title="carrot soup" /></a><a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/rachael-ray/curried-carrot-soup-recipe/index.html"><strong>Curried Carrot Soup:</strong></a><br />
<em>Adapted to save money From Rachael Ray<br />
12 servings/6 meals<br />
(6 ziplocks filled with 2 c. each)</em></p>

<p>I used Rachael Ray’s recipe as a guideline for making a cheaper version of the soup. Since I was making a lot of soup (ended up being 12 individual meals), I used 1 whole bag of the giant carrots instead of the baby carrots, 1/2 stick of butter, 2 tbsp. olive oil, 1-1/2 onions (chopped), salt to taste, cayenne pepper to taste, curry to taste (lots and lots of curry–don’t be shy). I also added 3 tbsps of honey to sweeten it a bit and break up the heavy carrot taste, you can probably just use a 2 tbsp or so of regular sugar for this. Last change was cutting out the sour cream to keep it healthier. Also, these soups always seem a bit thicker after thawing them so Jack and I will add water, milk or cream to them to make it more soupy and give us a bit more per serving.</p>

<p><strong>Roasted Red Potatoes:</strong><br />
<em>Makes about 7 meals for 2, 1-5lb bag)<br />
2-3 potatoes/person x 7</em></p>

<p>Jack and I wing this recipe every time. We ended up cutting 2-3 red potatoes into smaller cubes drizzle with olive oil, sprinkle with garlic, rosemary, pepper and a dash of salt. Toss potatoes to make sure they are thoroughly coated. Place in skillet, we use our cast-iron, place in oven at 350 degrees until they brown. Turn potatoes every 10 minutes to heat evenly and prevent burning. Pair with a larger portion of salad and veggies.</p>

<p>Also, did you know that according to food regulations, the bagged produce (like potatoes and onions) must weight at least what it says on the bag? Apparently this means that may times, distributors will throw in extra potatoes just to make sure they exceed the listed poundage. How does this help lower your grocery costs? If you weigh your bagged veggies, like onions and potatoes, you can end up with more bulk for your buck since the bags are a set price. Pretty neat, right?</p>

<p><strong>Chili:</strong><br />
<em>20 serv./10 meals<br />
(10 ziplocks filled with 2 c. each)</em></p>

<p>My chili recipe changes each month depending on spices and what not but typically it takes 1 bag of beans (kidney, black or pinto–we like kidney best). Yes, I said <em>bag</em>, meaning you must soak them overnight or attempt the quick-soak method which requires bringing the beans to a boil then letting them sit in the water for 1 hour before cooking. I quick soak when we get back from the store and then throw them in the crockpot, cover with water and let cook overnight. In the morning, I brown 1 lb of ground beef and toss it into the crockpot along with lots of onions, chili powder, garlic, a little cumin, some tomato sauce (small can), 2 small tomatoes, Worcestershire and my favorite part of our chili recipe–<em>cocoa powder</em>! Seriously, this is the best discovery of my cooking life thus far. The cocoa gives the chili such an incredible savory taste. If your chili tastes too tomato-y, add brown sugar and Worcestershire to balance it out. I’ll be making a fresh batch next month and will write down my steps to share with you all. For now, don’t be afraid to use your favorite chili recipe. The main money saver is buying bagged beans, purcasing your produce from a produce stand or farmer’s market, making do with what you have on hand and limiting fancy ingredients.</p>

<p>Now, I must admit, we have a bit of a leg-up in the meat department. We buy local grass-fed beef once a year, and I work on the farm that we buy it from in the summer so that is extra money I don’t have to factor into my monthly totals (not that it would increase it too much). Just be aware this will raise your monthly amount a bit more than ours. However, if you are able to find some, I highly recommend buying grass-fed beef locally–it’s delicious! We buy about 30lbs and it lasts us the entire year, so we don’t actually eat very much beef.</p>

<p><strong>Burgers:</strong><br />
<em>Makes 10 burger patties</em></p>

<p>Since we have ground beef on hand it seems a shame to not make a round of tasty burgers. I hate preparing burgers for just one night, it’s a lot dirty work for just the two of us. I decided to see how well I could freeze these guys. I broke out 2 lbs of beef and added 1 chopped onion, about 1 cup of bread crumbs (depends on how juicy your meat is), garlic powder, pepper, 3 tbsp Worcestershire, basil and a touch of salt.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/09/lower-your-grocery-bill-monthly-meals-part-2/dsc_0013-5/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/09/DSC_0013-325x216.jpg" alt="Perfect Burger Patties" title="Perfect Burger Patties" /></a>Next, I made perfectly round patties by placing a large round cookie cutter onto wax paper and pressing the meat mixture into the cookie cutter as a mold which when lifted up, reveals a perfectly round patty. Yes, I like consistency <em>that</em> much. I experimented and wrapped some of the patties in foil then in saran wrap and some just in a healthy layer of saran wrap. Both seemed to keep well in the freezer. The 2 lbs made 10 burgers that we then paired with $.20 corn cobs from the produce stand down the road.</p>

<em>2 sandwiches/eggplant</em></p>

<p>I have already written an entire post on these bad boys. They are SO SO SO delicious. My favorite nights of the month are our hot sandwiches. Once again, be creative! There are so many different ways to combine your simple foods that turn them into favorite family recipes.</p>

<p><strong>Chicken:</strong><br />
<em>1 large package yields roughly 10 baggies for 2 people</em></p>

<p>We eat quite a bit of chicken but we have learned how to combine well with other sides to make it stretch. First of all, we almost always buy our chicken at Walmart, the large 5 breast packages, and usually when it is $.99/lb. We buy boneless, skinless breasts but there are other things like drumsticks and what not that you can buy cheaper if that is more your style. The reason we stick to breasts is because of their versatility.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/09/lower-your-grocery-bill-monthly-meals-part-2/freezer-meals-monthly-shopping-4-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/09/freezer-meals-monthly-shopping-41-325x216.jpg" alt="chicken portions" title="chicken portions" /></a>The only other prep task you might see us doing the same night of our grocery run is cutting up our chicken and placing it into smaller baggies. We slice the breast in half thickness-wise (so it’s half as thick making it a quick thaw) then cut into strips and place 2 serving sizes (3-4 oz–it’s a small handful) in one ziplock baggie. To give you an idea, Jack and I usually get about 10-12 baggies of cut-up chicken out of 1 large package of chicken.</p>

<p>Now you have chicken in meal bags ready to freeze. We typically pull out one bag of chicken/meal, thaw and cook to go on a salad or with rice. We also give variety to our chicken meals by adding marinades to the chicken prior to cooking or experimenting with the seasoning. One of my favorite ways to cook chicken is to sprinkle it with Salad Supreme, pepper and garlic, saute onions and serve with rice. Our first month we also ate <strong>Jerk Chicken sandwiches</strong>, where we simply pulled the chicken out, poured caribbean jerk sauce into the bag while it thawed, cooked the chicken and served on a burger bun kind of like a sloppy joe but with lettuce, tomato and onion. Delicious!</p>

<p>Since the chicken makes many loose bags in the freezer we store it in what used to be our ice bin. The bin seems to be the perfect size for a full month of chicken baggies.</p>

<p><strong>Frittatas:</strong><br />
<em>4-5 eggs/1 large frittata</em></p>

<p>Eggs are pretty stinking cheap around here. We buy ours at the little produce stand down the road for $.99/dz and since it’s at the produce stand we allow ourselves to buy it more than once a month. Jack eats one egg pretty much every morning but we have also incorporated eggs into our evening meals (the open-faced sandwiches and frittatas). The frittata ends up being about $2/meal for two people so it is great on the wallet. This is basically like scrambling eggs with veggies but here’s how we make it: Cut up some veggies (onion, green pepper, tomatoes) and sautee in olive oil in a medium-sized saucepan, season with garlic, curry, pepper and a little bit of salt. Whisk together 4-5 eggs in a separate bowl with about 1 tbsp of milk. Once the veggies are ready, spread them evenly around the bottom of the pan and pour the egg mixture over the top. Your eggs should fill all the space around the veggies and just barely reach the top of the veggies (so basically, you want to still see your veggies sticking out in various places, don’t cover them like a soup). Sprinkle the eggs with a bit more seasoning and place a lid over the pan and let cook for about 20 minutes. The eggs should fluff up nicely and create a little egg pie–kind of a quiche-like consistency without the crust. Cut into the middle to make sure your eggs are cooked all the way through. Pull out of the oven, allow to cool and serve with toast.</p>

<p><strong>Sides:</strong></p>

<p>I’m not sure I need much explanation on our sides. But here’s a quick overview:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/09/lower-your-grocery-bill-monthly-meals-part-2/dsc_0037/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/09/DSC_0037-325x216.jpg" alt="salad" title="salad" /></a><strong>Salads</strong>–just like any salad, we make do with what veggies we have on hand. Sometimes that can include many ingredients (cheese, cucumber, tomatoes, oriental noodles, onions, pine nuts, hard-boiled eggs) and other times we just use the last bits of produce in the house which may just be onion and tomato. Sometimes we buy salad dressing if it is on sale but often we make individual portions of dressing to go on our salad. This dressing is a mixture of balsamic vinegar(2 tbsp), olive oil(2tbsp), lemon juice (1/2-1tbsp), garlic powder and pepper. We just combine these until we’ve reached the right amount of zing.</p>

<p>The <strong>red potatoes</strong> we cook just like the dinner version but we usually just need 1/person, so it’s a smaller batch.</p>

<p><strong>Grilled zucchini</strong>–cook however you normally would. We drizzle in olive oil with garlic and pepper sprinkled on top and place on the grill. We also grill it on skewers with peppers and onions.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/09/lower-your-grocery-bill-monthly-meals-part-2/dsc_0023/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/09/DSC_0023-325x240.jpg" alt="Zucchini Ribbon Salad" title="Zucchini Ribbon Salad" /></a><strong>Zucchini Ribbon Salad</strong>–Using a potato peeler, peel the zucchini in long ribbons and place in a bowl. Chop 1/2 of an onion and add to the bowl along with pepper and garlic (can you tell I like these two seasonings?). Prepare the balsamic/olive oil dressing listed above under “salads” and pour on top. I also usually have a package of pine nuts on hand for when I make pesto so I sprinkle those on top of this salad for a little added crunch. A small package of pine nuts costs about $2.38.</p>

<p><strong>Corn and other veggies</strong>– just grill as you normally would. This veggie item varies according to which produce is the best price and better quality.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/09/lower-your-grocery-bill-monthly-meals-part-2/homemaderolls-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/09/homemaderolls-2-325x232.jpg" alt="homemade dinner rolls " title="homemade dinner rolls " /></a><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/08/homemade-dinner-rolls/">Homemade Dinner Rolls</a>– these are incredibly easy to make and cost nearly nothing if you typically have flour and yeast on hand.</p>

<p><strong>Lunch:</strong></p>

<p>Obviously sandwiches need little explanation but Jack’s favorite lunch meal, <strong>seasoned rice and beans</strong>, is so stinkin’ simple, I wonder sometimes why he loves it so.</p>

<p>On Sunday evenings I usually cook a small batch of brown rice (1-2 cups), pull out some extra beans that I’ve already cooked and put in the freezer and put about 1/2 cup of each into a lunch container. I also add a little pepper, salt and garlic along with a little chopped onion and tomato. In the other half of his lunch I chop up some lettuce and veggies and voila! A warm and healthy lunch for him to enjoy and it took me all of 10 minutes to throw together three for the week. Sometimes I’ll shred some cheese to go on the rice and beans, other times, if we’ve found tortillas on sale that month, I’ll give him a tortilla to wrap the mixture into, just to give a little bit of variety. Of course, he likes his staples and still swears the simple rice and beans mixture is his favorite lunch item.</p>

<p>Jack also makes<a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/03/granola-trail-mix/"> <strong>homemade granola</strong></a> to eat with yogurt for snacks or lunches.</p>

<p>Here is a link to <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ApU9WwQlN06CdGl1akNXd2NZM29kV3BTS1VsdGRrS2c"><strong>my grocery list from month #1</strong></a>. Keep in mind, I chose my menu recipes based on some of the ingredients already in my home. This is <em>very important</em> to keeping your grocery bill low. It takes a few extra minutes to take inventory of your fridge, freezer and cupboards but it lowers the cost tremendously. Google Recipes can come in handy here if you don’t yet have staple meals for various recipes. You can go to Google and type in “chili recipes” then over on the left column click the items you already have and see what links appear that use those items. From there figure out what else you would need from the store to make that recipe. This was very helpful when I wanted to find a carrot soup recipe.</p>

<p>Anyways, I say all that to inform you that if the item is not on my grocery list but I listed it above in my recipe instructions, I already had that item at the house. In month #1 this mostly pertains to seasonings. Also, although throughout the month we buy our produce at various farmer’s markets and the local produce stand, our first trip of the month we tend to buy the bulk produce and maybe a few other items if needed at the store.</p>

<p>Ok, I think that is plenty of information for you all to process. Keep in mind this was my very first month of monthly meal planning so, now looking back, the meals are terribly exciting but they tasted good and worked well throughout the entire month. We even had leftovers of some of these items to use in month #2 which helped break up the meal routine.</p>

<p>As always, let me know if you have any questions at all or if anything is unclear. Good luck!</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/09/lower-your-grocery-bill-monthly-shopping-part-1/dsc_0008-4/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/09/DSC_0008-325x201.jpg" alt="lower grocery bill" title="lower grocery bill" /></a>This past year Jack and I have picked up the speed on our ongoing money-saving mission. Although we don’t make very much money (we each work a normal job, an odd job for extra cash, and go to school full time), we have figured out where we can scrimp and scrape without robbing all the fun out of our lives. Despite bringing in very little money each month we are able to continually put money into savings and still afford a few niceties from time to time. We are not one of those insanely strict couples who never ever strays from the plan because, let’s face it, some days you just need a cheeseburger, but we do try to abide by our little rule set as closely as possible. However, allowing ourselves the flexibility to say, “screw the plan, we need a night out,” has actually given us motivation to stick to our budgeting strategy more consistently.</p>

<p>Now, this post is not meant to be a long lesson on how to save money and budget well, although I may be sharing some of our strategies and tracking sheets eventually. No, I tell you all this to say that our latest step in the long process of living simply and saving money one small piece at a time is to cut down our grocery bill. We don’t spend a lot of money on groceries, especially with just two of us, but we had been noticing that those unexpected mini trips to the grocery store throughout the month were causing the bill to be much higher than necessary. That realization is all it took for me to start researching–have I mentioned how much I enjoy researching? If you don’t believe me you will with this next bit of news…I ordered a book from the library that solely discussed lowering your grocery bill. Let me further emphasize to you how much I enjoy researching, this book was 300 pages long and I read every single page <em>and</em> loved every minute! The book I chose was, “Cut Your Grocery Bill in Half with America’s Cheapest Family.” It was awesome! At first I didn’t think I would actually learn anything because I constantly read about cheap and healthy eating on blogs and I think Jack and I have learned a great deal about saving on groceries but trust me, if you think you know cheap grocery shopping, think again.</p>

<p>Although many methods of saving are presented in this book, you can choose to use just one or combine many of their strategies, for instance, I refuse to cut coupons so I disregarded that chapter of saving tips. The one strategy that has made the biggest impact on our grocery bill is once-a-month shopping. This was/is very appealing to Jack and I and our current lifestyle. Last year was our most difficult school-wise, we both had very full class loads plus work and we felt like we were losing our minds much of the time. Luckily though, I had the idea to make a bunch of freezer meals we could thaw to save time cooking once or twice a week. This idea of once-a-month shopping takes my random amount of freezer meals to an entirely different level. Shopping once a month can seem like a daunting task, but if you check into it with an open mind, I believe you’ll agree it saves time, energy, money and effort.</p>

<p>Last month we spent $90 at the grocery store and $14 in produce for the entire month. Keep in mind this is just for two people but still, with all of our extra trips we were spending about $100 more than that.</p>

<p>The idea with this once-a-month shopping trip is to stock up on items that are on sale and that complement what you already have in your cabinets and fridge. Once you decide what you have to work with, choose a few recipes(6 to 8). You want your recipes to be simple and freezable. Of course, if every single meal is frozen you may find yourself lacking in produce. Jack and I, remedy this by adding a side (salad, rice, red potatoes, or grilled veggies) to every meal. We also have one night a week where we make some sort of breakfast meal, usually something with eggs–<a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/08/grilled-eggplant-tomato-aioli-sandwiches/">eggplant, egg &amp; aioli sandwiches</a> or frittatas. This month we also added BLTs to our weekly mix because turkey bacon was BOGO at Ingles, so for $2.38 we bought 2 packages of turkey bacon (12 slices in each), one is in the fridge and one the freezer for later in the month. Be creative with your recipe selection, although a large portion of your food will reside in the freezer, there are many other ways to incorporate fresh vegetables and other ingredients that won’t break the bank.</p>

<p>The next step is to write a menu for the month (this is the trickier part). Once you’ve chosen your recipes see how many portions each will make and how many meals this will actually amount to for your family. If you made a fabulous vegetable soup that contains 8-1 cup servings, you can scoop 2 cups into a baggie, flatten, freeze and have 4 meals ready to go for 2 people (remember you are pairing this with salad and perhaps a roll, so 1 cup is a normal serving size). Not all recipes end up having exceptional accuracy on serving size so I’ve now reached a point where I make my final monthly menu (actually write the meals on each day of the month) <em>after</em> I’ve cooked everything and seen how many meals it made.</p>

<p>Now that I’ve touched on writing a menu, let me take a moment to address keeping your produce fresh. Shopping once a month has taken a little bit of the variety out of our produce, for instance I don’t experiment too much with the fruits &amp; vegetables we buy and basically just stick to apples and bananas to pair with our lunches. Other great fruits and vegetables that seem to last longer include grapes, carrots, oranges, celery, red potatoes, sweet potatoes, &amp; zucchini. However, you are still able to incorporate those shorter-shelf-life fruits and veggies as long as you plan your menus well. If you buy avocados, buy some that aren’t quite ripe so you can hang on to them a few more days. If you need them to hurry up and ripen, toss them in a paper bag for the afternoon and they’ll ripen up quickly. If you buy them ripe, plan your meal so that you use those items in your first week of meals. Since we buy produce about twice a month, our 1st and 3rd weeks typically have more fresh veggies incorporated into the meals but that is not to say the week 2 and 4 are lacking, it’s just a different type of produce. Make sense? Back to our shopping steps.</p>

<p>Now, of course, you need to go to the store (or brave it before menu writing but after choosing your recipes). We go to 2 stores now. The week that we end up buying food, instead of giving in to the idea of coupon-ing (I just won’t devote that much time), we buy a Sunday paper and look at which store has the most deals with their “club card” that fits the most items on my shopping list. For instance, this month Ingles had about 75% of the items on my list (or some version of them–be flexible!) on sale and most of those were BOGO. We went there first and I purchased the sale items only, then I brought along last month’s receipt from Walmart and checked some of our staple items to see how their prices compared. If the staple item was cheaper than what Walmart had listed last month than I bought it at Ingles, if not, I head over to Wally World and purchase the item there instead. So yes, two stores in one night, it sounds crazy but it only took 20 minutes longer than my old shopping trips used to take AND I am not having to go back to the store ALL MONTH LONG. We shop on Friday nights, if you go later in the evening you can get discounted meats and breads (discounted meat is OK to buy just smell it first, it shouldn’t go bad if you put it back in the freezer–take advantage of the discount!). Friday evenings are also typically a quieter time to go gallivanting about the grocery aisles.</p>

<p>Once you’ve purchased all your items, bring them on home, pat yourself on the back and take a break. I like shopping on a Friday cause I can get beans soaking overnight for chili or to go in our rice and bean lunches and then get to work on the other meals in the morning after a nice long evening of sleep. When you prepare your freezer meals, take extra time at the beginning to <em>get organized</em>. This one day of cooking goes by very quickly if you can recognize ahead of time how many onions you will need to chop up, how much ground beef you need to brown, which casseroles can go in the oven together, what you can place in a crockpot and so on.</p>

<p>Once your meals have cooled, break them into individual or family-sized portions to freeze. If a recipe makes 4 servings and you are cooking for two people, split the meal into two baggies or containers so you only have to thaw what you are going to eat that evening. We have also discovered strategies for making the most of a very small freezer for those of you without a separate one, like us. If you do have a separate freezer, I even more highly recommend reading the book mentioned above. The family has so many more tips for those of you who can buy multiple gallons of milk, cheese, and so on.</p>

<p>Alright, if you are still with me, thanks for hanging in there, we are getting close! If you didn’t write your menu on a white board or some other handy visual prior to shopping, now’s the time to do so. Once again, I now find this easier to do <em>after</em> I have all the food prepared and laid out in front of me. You’ll quickly find that many of the recipes make more portions than you will need in one month. This is when meal planning gets really fun! Now you get to start having more variety in the following months. Example: Last month I made a giant batch of chili and a giant batch of carrot soup so this month I still have 5 packages of each leftover. I can now add those meals into the mix for this month’s menu, make the same amount of new meals to mix in and then, voila! More variety and you guessed it, even more left over the next month. I also like having the extra meals because it makes giving away a meal so simple.</p>

<p>You may be wondering what about breakfast and lunch? Well, here’s where we may vary a bit on pricing. I rarely eat more than a piece of toast and a banana for breakfast and Jack has 1 egg and a slice of toast so we are very boring there. For lunches we typically rotate PB&amp;J, tuna, or a little rice and beans mix (will share recipe later) with a side salad. All very inexpensive lunch items to incorporate into your routine and none of which require making and freezing ahead of time. So, our lunches add extra bread, PB, jelly, tuna, a large bag of rice, and bagged beans to the shopping list. These are almost always on our list and are usually pretty inexpensive even without a sale.</p>

<p>As I mentioned before, our sides typically consist of rice, salad, veggies or roasted red potatoes. I usually just rotate these around with the freezer meals so we aren’t always eating the same main course with the same side–break up that routine. We also bake a batch of <a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/08/homemade-dinner-rolls/">homemade dinner rolls</a> to go with our soups each month. These cost next to nothing if you already carry a few basic baking supplies in your kitchen. Which raises yet another point, baking a few items from scratch–bread, rolls, pizza dough–goes a long way to keeping you on budget while giving you variety.</p>

<p>Are you overwhelmed yet? I know it’s a lot of information to take in but I promise 2 months in you’ll be singing it’s praises just like I was. I will leave you to soak in this information but will be posting our first month’s grocery plan with recipes and more details in the next few days. I will also be posting tips on storing all this food in a tiny freezer, showing you menu options and my grocery price tracking system. I hope you’ve enjoyed this little peak into the way we’ve learned to cut our grocery bill in half!</p>

    <p>Our kitchen has seen much progress in the past 4 years as Jack and I develop new ways of cooking that keep us healthy, provide warm homemade meals, and save time. This past year we started following some of the Biggest Loser protein menu guidelines to help define our eating styles. We both attend classes and run back and forth between 2 other jobs–this means our eating time is limited and usually involves us scarfing down whatever is quick and easy. Not to mention the hassle of coming home and attempting to prepare dinner. By the time 6 o’clock rolls around, the last thing we want to do is thaw and prep food. The Biggest Loser protein packed menus are fabulous (<a href="http://www.prevention.com/biggest-loser-biggest-loser-meal-plan-0">sample menu</a>), because as the name suggests, they are packed with protein. What does that mean for us? We can eat less throughout the day and still remain full and energized enough to exercise those valuable brain cells. <a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/01/how-to-prepare-freezer-meals/dsc_0037-nef/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/01/DSC_0037.NEF_-325x205.jpg" alt="" title="DSC_0037.NEF" /></a></p>

<p><strong>What does our daily food system usually consist of?</strong></p>

<p><em>Breakfast:</em> 1 slice whole grain toast, 2 poached egg whites, 8 oz fat-free milk, coffee, fruit (you can even have 2 sausage links in this meal plan)</p>

<p><em>Snack:</em> 1 medium apple, sliced, with 1 tablespoon peanut butter or 1 non-fat yogurt cup, 1 nature oats granola bar</p>

<p>_Lunch:_Black Bean Burrito with salsa, onions, tomatoes, romaine lettuce, and 1 wheat tortilla or 2 cups chopped romaine lettuce, tomato, cucumber and 4 oz lemon-pepper seasoned chicken (cooked ahead of time and separated into baggies to freeze)</p>

<p><em>Dinner:</em> This is where we added in a bit of variety. Usually we pair fish with either 1 cup of brown rice, a side salad, or 1 serving of penne pasta with vegetables.</p>

<p>However, with school in full swing I pre-made 37 freezer meals for two in order to help us stay healthy, eat smaller portions and still have time for the necessary nightly study extravaganza. <a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/01/how-to-prepare-freezer-meals/dsc_0044-nef/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/01/DSC_0044.NEF_-575x426.jpg" alt="" title="Freezer Meals" /></a></p>

<p>The meals I included are made from fresh ingredients and are separated into moderate serving sizes. Most of these meals are to be paired with either brown rice or a side salad for a healthy and filling meal.</p>

<p><strong>Spring Semester Freezer Meals:</strong></p>

<p><em>Roasted Red Pepper and Tomato-Basil Soup</em><br />
Yields: 8 cups<br />
Serving Size: 1 cup<br />
2-Person Meals: 4<br />
Pair with: salad or homemade wheat bread</p>

<p><em>BBQ Chili</em><br />
Yields: 10 cups<br />
Serving Size: 1/2 cup<br />
2-Person Meals: 10<br />
Pair with: 1/2 cup brown rice or homemade wheat bread</p>

<p><em>Vegetable Pork Roast</em><br />
Yields: 10 cups<br />
Serving Size: 1 cup<br />
2-Person Meals: 5<br />
Pair with: 1/2 cup brown rice or side salad</p>

<p><em>Steamed Vegetables</em><br />
Yields: 18 cups<br />
Serving Size: 1 cup<br />
2-Person Meals: 9<br />
Pair with: 1 cup brown rice or 1 cup penne pasta<br />
Note: We eat vegetables with everything so you can throw these into the steamer basket while your rice cooks or toss them into a pasta dish or simple cook as a side to go with your fish.</p>

<p><em>Rump Roast</em><br />
Yields: 44 oz<br />
Serving Size: 4 oz<br />
2-Person Meals: 11<br />
Pair with: sandwiches, salads, tacos, soups, pasta, etc<br />
Note: I cooked an extra roast and shred the meat just to have extra meat on hand for whatever other dish we may want to throw together. I didn’t do anything special to this meat so there could be a variety of uses.</p>

<p><em>Pinto Beans</em><br />
Note: I cooked 1 whole bag of dry pinto beans, using 3 cups for the chili, 2 cups to make hummus (great low-calorie snack), and 2 cups of leftover to use as a side or to throw into a stew. The bag only cost $1.49 and the resulting meals make the extra cook time worthwhile.</p>

<p>I was able to buy all of the ingredients for these freezer meals including a large bag of brown rice and salad fixings to go along with the meals for under $100. The only part that wasn’t included was the rump roast and 1 lb of ground beef because we bought grass-fed beef last summer from the Doan’s farm.</p>

<p><strong>Freezer Meals Tips:</strong></p>

<p>1.) When dividing your portions into baggies, think about how much unthawing/rethawing you want to do. I don’t put more than 4 individual portions into each bag, i.e. 2 nights of meals for 2 people.</p>

<p>2.) Flatten bags of food onto cookie sheets to freeze. Once frozen remove from sheet and stack upright to conserve freezer space.</p>

<p>3.) Many people will tell you not to cook your meat ahead of time for beef/pork crockpot meals as you will lose some of the flavor. I have frozen crockpot meals both ways, and I didn’t think it made that much of a difference so if I have time to cook it all ahead of time I will. Chicken, however, you really should cook ahead of time if mixing with other foods.</p>

<p>4.) As always, be creative. You might be amazed to find that most of your meals can be prepped ahead of time and set out to thaw or thrown into a crockpot to cook or even just thaw all day. And let’s face it, who doesn’t like coming home after a crappy day to a house that smells like Grandma’s old-fashioned pot roast? Brings a smile to my face just thinking about it.</p>

<p>5.) Keep your freezer organized. I’m a stickler for organization. I love thinking of ways to organize and the process of organizing my life. For instance, my favorite part about January is buying a new planner for the year–so refreshing! I grabbed an old filing bin to store our randomly packaged meats. It also works well for “filing” flattened soup ziplocks. You can find little bins of all sizes to fit your freezer at the dollar tree so don’t let a few dollars discourage you from years of organized freezer bliss.</p>

<p>I hope you’ve enjoyed these few ideas and tips. I will be posting my freezer meal recipes throughout the next few posts. If you have any questions, suggestions, or tips to share please send them my way.</p>

<p>Happy freezing!</p>

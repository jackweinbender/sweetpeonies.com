    <p>Last weekend the hubby and I had our first outing with friends in Austin. After two weeks of unpacking, rearranging, exploring, getting stuck in traffic, filling out paperwork, and getting stuck in more traffic we were invited to dinner by a fellow PhD student from Jack’s program. Our task: dessert.</p>

<p><img src="{{page.assets}}raspberry-drop-chocolate-cupcakes-1.jpg" alt="Raspberry Drop Chocolate Cupcakes - Sweet Peonies" /></p>

<p>I decided to branch out from my typical go-to desserts and make something new. Austin’s fresh, organic fruits and vegetables have completely won me over so I wanted to make a dessert that would highlight one of these beauties. The result? Raspberry drop chocolate cupcakes. With a hint of coffee and a fresh juicy raspberry baked into the center, the cupcakes were covered in rich chocolate frosting and finally sprinkled with lemon zest. Unfortunately, the Texas heat turned my frosting into more of a glaze but they were still incredibly satisfying.</p>

<p><img src="{{page.assets}}raspberry-drop-chocolate-cupcakes-2.jpg" alt="Raspberry Drop Chocolate Cupcakes - Sweet Peonies" /></p>

<p>The recipe I used comes from a magazine the hubby bought for me a while back, “<em>Taste of Home</em> 100 Best Desserts.” I altered a few minor ingredients and instructions. The original recipe called for a drop of seedless raspberry jam in the center but I wanted the tangy flavor of a fresh raspberry instead. I also left out the coffee liquor in the frosting, mainly because I didn’t have any, but also because the added liquid would not help the frosting harden in this heat. My last change was adding the lemon zest on top. It seems small and perhaps insignificant but I loved the faint hint of lemon and raspberry with every bite.</p>

<p><img src="{{page.assets}}raspberry-drop-chocolate-cupcakes-3.jpg" alt="Raspberry Drop Chocolate Cupcakes - Sweet Peonies" /></p>

<p>The recipe said it made 2 1/2 dozen cupcakes, but I would estimate it making closer to 3 1/2 dozen. I filled my cupcake liners 2/3 full and after 2 dozen, still had close to half the batter leftover. My last observation, the batter looked more liquid-y than any other cupcake recipe I have used. I was very skeptical that it wouldn’t cook in the time allotted but they cooked perfectly. So, if you are anything like me and tend to change recipes before seeing them through to completion, <em>don’t do it</em>. Trust me, you will be pleasantly surprised on this one.</p>

<p><img src="{{page.assets}}raspberry-drop-chocolate-cupcakes-4.jpg" alt="Raspberry Drop Chocolate Cupcakes - Sweet Peonies" /></p>

<p>I’ll leave you with the recipe now while I figure out what to do with 3 1/2 dozen cupcakes.</p>

<p><strong><em>Raspberry Drop Chocolate Cupcakes</em></strong></p>

<p><em>Batter</em>
1 c. baking cocoa
2 c. boiling water
1 c. butter, softened
2 1/2 c. sugar
4 eggs
2 tbsp cold brewed coffee
2 tsp vanilla
2 3/4 c. flour
2 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp salt
1 small package fresh raspberries</p>

<p><em>Frosting</em>
1 can coconut milk (13.6 oz)
1 pkg. dark chocolate chips (12 oz)
1/2 c. butter, cubed
1/3 c. confectioners sugar
1 lemon (to zest)</p>

<p>I recommend beginning with the frosting, which is supposed to refrigerate for 1 1/2 hours, a detail I missed on the first read-through. Translation: long pause between cupcakes being complete and being able to chow down on the finished product.</p>

<p>Spoon 1 cup of cream from the top of coconut milk and place into a saucepan to boil. Once the cream starts to boil, remove from heat and add chocolate chips, whisking smooth. Stir in butter and confectioner’s sugar. Refrigerate for 1 1/2 hrs or until well chilled.</p>

<p>Now to the cupcakes, preheat the oven to 350 degrees. In a small bowl, combine cocoa and boiling water and set aside to cool.</p>

<p>In a second bowl, cream the softened butter and sugar until fluffy. Add eggs one at a time until well combined. Add coffee and vanilla. Combine flour, salt, baking powder &amp; soda and add to creamed mixture alternately with cocoa mixture.</p>

<p>Fill cupcake liners 2/3 full, drop a whole raspberry into the center (no need to push it down, just set on top and the batter will cook up around it). Bake for 18-20 minutes, until toothpick comes out clean.</p>

<p>Cool for at least 10 minutes before frosting.</p>

<p>Once the frosting has chilled, beat mixture until soft peaks form. They said this should take about 15 seconds. We had to take ours out of the fridge early due to poor planning and so it took longer than 15 seconds to see soft peaks.</p>

<p>Frost cupcakes. Grate lemon zest over frosting and top it all off with another raspberry. Enjoy!</p>

    <p>With only a couple of weeks until classes start again for the husband, we are determined to make the most of the beautiful weather and our remaining free time. Sadly, hiding out in the comforts of an air conditioned home in Texas in the middle of the summer sounds and feels all too enticing. Today however, we laced up our hiking boots and set out in search of new adventures.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, our lazy Saturday morning attitude came back to bite us in the caboose and we didn’t get out to the trails until almost noon.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2013/08/barton-creek-greenbelt/barton-creek-greenbelt-15/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2013/08/Barton-Creek-Greenbelt-15-575x381.jpg" alt="Barton Creek Greenbelt (15)" /></a><br />

<p>Today’s adventures took us to Austin’s Barton Creek Greenbelt. The trails have large limestone cliffs, dense foliage and shallow bodies of water (although today, they were dry-as-a-bone).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2013/08/barton-creek-greenbelt/barton-creek-greenbelt-8/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2013/08/Barton-Creek-Greenbelt-8-575x865.jpg" alt="Barton Creek Greenbelt (8)" /></a><br />

<p>For those of you (like me) who have never heard of a greenbelt, it is a protected natural or semi-natural environment around an urban area. Barton Creek is maintained by the Parks and Recreation Department of Austin and is meant to improve air quality, provide urban residents with access to countryside and outdoor recreation, and give character to urban areas.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2013/08/barton-creek-greenbelt/barton-creek-greenbelt-5/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2013/08/Barton-Creek-Greenbelt-5-575x381.jpg" alt="Barton Creek Greenbelt (5)" /></a><br />

<p>Since it was nearly noon by the time we arrived at the trails, our hike and “go-get-em attitudes” didn’t last long. However, I wouldn’t leave without snapping a few photos to share with you all.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2013/08/barton-creek-greenbelt/barton-creek-greenbelt-13/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2013/08/Barton-Creek-Greenbelt-13-575x381.jpg" alt="Barton Creek Greenbelt (13)" /></a><br />

<p>Stay tuned for more adventures from Austin.</p>

    <p>Austin welcomed us with open arms and hot weather last week. The city recorded 15 days over 100 degrees and while this heat is causing even the locals to think twice about heading outdoors, the husband and I are LOVING it!</p>

<p>I thought today I would simply share a few photos of downtown Austin and the capitol building. Be warned, these were taken on the hubby’s ipod from a moving car. We’re hoping to take the camera out on a stroll this weekend so stay tuned for more pictures and hopefully some exciting discoveries.</p>

    <p>Austin Countdown: T-17 days. That’s right, in just two weeks the hubby and I will be packing the wagons and heading to the big land of Texas where Jack will work hard on his PhD and I will lounge lazily by the pool, work on my tan and eat Fro-Yo. Have I mentioned I am still unemployed? Hopefully that will change soon after we get settled and then off to work for me as well. Now, on to more tasty topics…With most of our home packed into boxes, there have been few projects for me to share with you, that is, until this week.</p>

<p>Jack and I have been on a constant scouting mission for avocados. Avocados are my all time favorite summer food. Unfortunately, finding these delicious fruits is easier said than done. Produce options are ridiculously limited in our small town and when we do find a decent batch, they typically sell for around $2/fruit. Yikes! Lately, our local produce stand down the street has had a fairly good showing of avocado however and we have been taking full advantage.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2013/07/mango-avocado-salsa-chili-coke-chicken/mango-avocado-salsa-chili-coke-chiken-3/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2013/07/Mango-Avocado-Salsa-Chili-Coke-Chiken-3-575x381.jpg" alt="Mango Avocado Salsa &amp; Chili-Coke Chiken (3)" /></a></p>

<p>This week, we had avocado every night. Since the weather here is hot and sticky, we wanted our meal to highlight the avocado flavor and also remain light and fresh tasting. Here’s what we came up with:</p>

<p><em>Mango Avocado Salsa &amp; Chili-Coke Chicken over Spinach and a Toasted Tortilla</em></p>

<p>That sounds long and complicated as I write it out but it is pretty simple and incredibly delicious.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2013/07/mango-avocado-salsa-chili-coke-chicken/mango-avocado-salsa-chili-coke-chiken-4/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2013/07/Mango-Avocado-Salsa-Chili-Coke-Chiken-4-575x411.jpg" alt="Mango Avocado Salsa &amp; Chili-Coke Chiken (4)" /></a></p>

<p><em>Chili-Coke Chicken</em></p>

<p>2 chicken breasts<br />
1 tbsp red pepper flakes<br />
1 tbsp Adobo seasoning<br />
2 tbsp Brown sugar<br />
pepper to taste<br />
coke to taste –start at 1 tsp<br />
rum to taste –start at 1 tsp<br />
2 tsp lemon juice</p>

<p>Boil 2 chicken breasts until cooked. Run cold water over chicken and shred. Mix above ingredients, adjust according to taste. All our sauces are done by taste so these are rough measurements. Toss chicken with seasoning and let sit.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2013/07/mango-avocado-salsa-chili-coke-chicken/mango-avocado-salsa-chili-coke-chicken-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2013/07/Mango-Avocado-Salsa-Chili-Coke-Chicken-575x381.jpg" alt="Mango Avocado Salsa &amp; Chili-Coke Chicken" /></a></p>

<p><em>Mango Avocado Salsa</em></p>

<p>1 Mango<br />
1 Avocado<br />
1/4 cup chopped red onion<br />
1/8 cup chopped fresh cilantro<br />
1/4 cup yellow tomato chopped<br />
1/4 Feta Cheese<br />
1 tsp lemon juice<br />
salt and pepper to taste</p>

<p>Combine ingredients by tossing gently. Set Aside.</p>

<p>Next, pour 1-2 tsp of olive oil into a pan. Allow the oil to warm up and then toss your tortilla into the oil. Cook on each side until slightly crisp.</p>

<p>Pile spinach on top of the tortillas, followed by the chicken and topped off with the mango avocado salsa. Enjoy!</p>

    <p>Nothing quite compares to the thrill of that first refreshing splash of summer. The anticipation as you drive toward the lake, the squeal of delight as your toes dip playfully at the water’s edge and the rush of adrenaline as you hold your breath and dive on in. The humid summers of East Tennessee have made me appreciate more fully the therapeutic refreshment that water brings. Whether it be by poolside, lake, river, or ocean, water gives us a chance to beat the heat, both literally or figuratively. Although for many the mayhem of work continues into the summer, the endless heat eventually beckons people out of their cubicles, into their cars, and toward the water.</p>

<p>While we can’t spend every moment of summer lakeside with a drink in hand, we <em>can</em> find some satisfaction in the refreshments of summer. I’m talking Mojitos, people!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2013/06/summer-refreshments-mojitos/dsc_0036-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2013/06/DSC_0036-575x411.jpg" alt="Virgin Mojitos" /></a></p>

<p>The hubby and I have been experimenting with different refreshing cocktails this summer, and while I’m always game for the traditional Mojito, I wanted to try an alcohol-free version that would taste light, refreshing and full of summer. Today I attempted a Mojito spritzer. There is no fancy trick to this little number, just simple minty deliciousness.</p>

<p><em>Recipe:</em><br />
1 oz simple syrup/1oz lime juice (Cheat: 2 oz Mojito Mix)<br />
10 Mint Leaves<br />
3 oz Club Soda<br />
1 tsp. brown sugar<br />
Ice</p>

<p><em>To Mix:</em><br />
Grind fresh mint leaves with brown sugar in separate bowl and place in shaker. Place ice in cocktail shaker. Add Mojito Mix or simple syrup and lime juice. Shake. Pour into glass. Add club soda. If you prefer less minty flavor, simply add more club soda or you can always add rum.</p>

    <p>For some individuals, creativity seems to pour out with ease, turning everything they touch into creativity gold. For others, coming up with something creative is a more labored, time consuming process requiring hours of research scouring blogs and reading articles, testing recipes, practicing new techniques, ruining much anticipated projects, writing and rewriting, taking photo after photo after photo… Can you guess which one of these categories I fall into?</p>

<p>That’s right. I’m a “creativity is a painstaking process” personality and I wouldn’t trade it for the world. Because I have tried and failed at so many projects, I have branched out and discovered the world of creativity is ginormous! From childhood to now I’ve dabbled in drawing, beading, photography, scrapbooking, painting, cooking, sewing, baking, woodworking, furniture restoration, interior design, blogging, violin, photography again, flowers, flowers and more flowers. With so many different avenues to explore, how could I possibly settle on just one? If I <em>could</em> choose just one creative venture, perhaps I would find myself excelling, but until that day, the randomness of my projects will continue.</p>

<p>Now to what you all are wanting to see, flowers! Unfortunately, as Jack and I prepare for our big move to Austin, my time on the farm has slowed significantly. However, Kristin and I recently arranged a wedding for a Tennessee bride. The table arrangements were fairly simple–three wine bottles with three different arrangements in each. The showstopper was the bride’s bouquet (thank you Kristin). Kristin’s finished design was exquisite. We decided to wrap the stems in simple burlap with three pearl pins so nothing took away from the beautiful colors. The finished product: a bold and beautiful bridal bouquet.</p>

<p>It’s flower time on the farm! The hubby and I are preparing for a big move to the big land of Texas, of course that’s not about to stop me from enjoying a few last summer days on the farm. I spent the morning with my dear friend Kristin getting ready for a wedding this weekend. Linda was able to sneak away on a little vacation, so while she’s away, we get to play! Stay tuned this weekend for snapshots of our arranging.</p>

    <p>It is finally here, after 7 long years of dedicated studies I am finally graduating with my BSN degree! I must apologize for the lack of posting this semester, my mother’s mantra still rings in my head, “studies come first,” and so, blogging has taken a back seat. However, with graduation less than a week away I wanted to share with you a few images from my graduation celebration wishlist.</p>

<p>The following are ideas I’ve combined to make a Graduation Thyme Garden Party Celebration come to life. I hope these ideas spark your creativity as you prepare for your own graduation celebrations in the coming weeks.</p>

    <p>It’s springtime here in Tennessee and I could not be more pleased!</p>

<p>Here are a few of my favorite things about Spring:<br />
<em>1.) Dew on the grass every morning<br />
2.) Sunshine and blue skies<br />
3.) Tiny flower buds sprouting up through the ground<br />
4.) Planting my garden<br />
5.) Grilling out</em></p>

<p>This spring, like many before, has already been filled with a plethora of baby showers (all boys). I always know spring is coming when the baby shower invitations begin to roll in. In the past 2 weeks I have had 4 baby showers to attend and I must say, this quickly exhausts my creative abilities and available time trying to come up with something cute and unique for each person.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2013/04/diaper-burp-cloths/diaperburpcloths-6/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2013/04/diaperburpcloths-6-575x384.jpg" alt="diaper burp cloth; diy" /></a></p>

<p>This year I’ve decided to try out the famous redesigned diaper burp cloths. I always like this idea but up until a few weeks ago had never actually tried my hand at crafting these sweet gifts.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2013/04/diaper-burp-cloths/diaperburpcloths-10/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2013/04/diaperburpcloths-10-575x384.jpg" alt="diaper burp cloth; diy" /></a></p>

<p>I purchased a couple packs of pre-folded cloth diapers from osocozy.com. They also have flat diapers if you prefer the shape. I found that the pre-folded diapers provide clean lines to measure &amp; match to my printed fabric. Next I purchased a fairly inexpensive pack of three receiving blankets, also pre-folded.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2013/04/diaper-burp-cloths/diaperburpcloths-5/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2013/04/diaperburpcloths-5-575x384.jpg" alt="diaper burp cloth; diy" /></a></p>

<p>The three sections made by the folds in the receiving blanket perfectly matched the width of the three sections on my diapers. This made it simple to cut three strips out of the receiving blankets and place one in the center strip of the diaper. Once in place, I folded under the edges of the receiving blanket and pinned in place.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2013/04/diaper-burp-cloths/diaperburpcloths-7/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2013/04/diaperburpcloths-7-575x384.jpg" alt="diaper burp cloth; diy" /></a></p>

<p>Next I chose a fancy hem design from my sewing machine and sewed around the edges of the receiving blanket fabric, making sure half of the stitch was on the blanket and half off as I stitched around.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2013/04/diaper-burp-cloths/diaperburpcloths-3/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2013/04/diaperburpcloths-3-575x381.jpg" alt="diaper burp cloth; diy" /></a></p>

<p>That’s it! If you cut all our strips first then place, fold and pin all together, then sew all together, you can whip up about 6 of these in less than 1 hour.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2013/04/diaper-burp-cloths/diaperburpcloths-12/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2013/04/diaperburpcloths-12-575x381.jpg" alt="diaper burp cloth; diy" /></a></p>

<p>All in all I was very pleased with this project and look forward to trying more variations in the future.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2013/04/diaper-burp-cloths/diaperburpcloths-9/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2013/04/diaperburpcloths-9-575x381.jpg" alt="diaper burp cloths, diy" /></a></p>

    <p>A couple weekends ago, I had the pleasure of helping out with baby shower decorations for my sweet friend Jane. Her and the hubster are expecting their first child in the next few weeks. My friend Kristin and I decided to broaden the trendy whale baby shower theme to a sailor baby shower. Instead of cutesy whales, we went with boyish flags in bold colors and homemade life preservers.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2013/04/sailor-baby-shower/sailorshower-1/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2013/04/sailorshower-1-575x359.jpg" alt="Sailor Shower; baby shower" /></a></p>

<p>Kristin found these awesome nautical signal flag patterns at <a href="http://www.purlbee.com/the-purl-bee/2011/6/26/lauras-loop-nautical-flag-napkins.html">PurlBee: Laura’s Loop</a>. The ones on the site are napkins, ours were simply flags made out of felt squares. To assemble, we cut strips of felt and hot glued them onto larger blocks of felt, making a flag for each letter of the alphabet. The life preservers are from a picture Kristin found on Pinterest. Unfortunately there was not a usable link to share with you. To assemble we used 2 foam rings, cut them in half to make 4 rings and wrapped white and red streamers around them to make little life preservers. Linda from <a href="http://auntwillieswildflowers.wordpress.com/">Aunt Willie’s Wildflowers</a> brought the daffodils in blue vases to place in the center of the life preservers.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2013/04/sailor-baby-shower/sailorshower-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2013/04/sailorshower-2-575x359.jpg" alt="sailor shower; baby shower; paper boats" /></a></p>

<p>I found the adorable origami paper boats at <a href="http://ilovethisandthat.blogspot.com/2013/03/origami-paper-boat.html">I Love This and That</a>. I used colored printer paper and cardstock instead of the vellum and cut my paper to 5×7.5in. I would recommend using paper no thicker than printer paper, the cardstock boats were a bit more difficult to fold once you get to the last steps.</p>

<p>The food selection consisted of a beautiful,colorful &amp; tasty salad bar.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2013/04/sailor-baby-shower/sailorshower-3/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2013/04/sailorshower-3-575x359.jpg" alt="salad bar; baby shower; sailor theme" /></a></p>

<p>And, of course, what baby shower is complete without the mother-to-be and all her friends and family.</p>

    <p>Lately in our little corner of the world, we’ve been catching tiny glimpses of spring. While parts of our country are still trudging through a constant flurry of snowflakes and torrents of rain, here in Tennessee we are seeing longer, brighter days as the sunshine makes an early debut. All I can say is it has been glorious!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2013/02/dolls-daylight/dollsanddaylight-4/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2013/02/DollsandDaylight-4-575x383.jpg" alt="DollsandDaylight (4)" /></a></p>

<p>The other day, I received my West Elm catalog in the mail. If you haven’t discovered <a href="http://www.westelm.com/">West Elm</a> you should head over to their website for a peak at hundreds of lovely home decorating ideas. When I opened the front page, I was met with this image of bright, cheery, sunshiney goodness.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2013/02/dolls-daylight/dollsanddaylight-5/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2013/02/DollsandDaylight-5-575x381.jpg" alt="DollsandDaylight (5)" /></a></p>

<p>It made my day and only affirmed what I’ve known in my heart these past few days, spring really <em>is</em> coming!</p>

<p>In the few moments of spare time I’ve had lately, I’ve been working on a trial doll project for my niece’s birthday. I recently finished my doll’s body and thought I would share the results. I have seen many doll patterns floating around the internet but they all seemed too complicated to attempt until I found this <a href="http://www.marthastewart.com/264299/black-apple-doll?lnc=38f9cf380e1dd010VgnVCM1000005b09a00aRCRD&amp;rsc=showmain_tv_the-martha-stewart-show">Black Apple Doll pattern on Martha Stewart’s website</a>.</p>

<p>The pattern is from Emily Martin who is well-known from her Etsy shop, <a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/theblackapple">The Black Apple</a> (be sure to check out her <a href="http://www.theblackapple.typepad.com/">blog</a> too). I am also working on a few clothing items to fit the doll–a hat, scarf, dress, apron, etc. As you can see, Ms. Dolly has no face yet, I can’t seem to decide what type of face she should have but will be sure to post pictures when I do.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2013/02/dolls-daylight/dollsanddaylight-11-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2013/02/dollsanddaylight-111-575x411.jpg" alt="fabric doll pattern" /></a></p>

<p>I am also working on backdrops to fit into a suitcase so Ms. Dolly has a home of her own. Check out these wonderfully creative <a href="http://hartandsew.blogspot.com/2011/01/doll-suitcase.html">doll suitcases at Hart &amp; Sew</a>.</p>

    <p><em>Hello Friends! Jack and I are working hard to wrap up this last semester of school which, unfortunately, means very little time to share fun projects with you. Luckily, I have a wonderfully talented and creative friend (Kira) who was willing to help me out with posting. Kira and her husband are both incredibly talented photographers based in Oregon. Head over to her <a href="http://www.kiraandmatt.com">website</a> for a peek at her work. Today Kira is sharing a super easy and fun lace sweatshirt DIY. Enjoy!</em></p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2013/02/diy-lace-sleeve-sweatshirt/libraryandlace-3153/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2013/02/libraryandlace-3153-575x862.png" alt="libraryandlace-3153" /></a></p>

<p>So excited to share this super easy DIY with all you lovely Sweet Peonies readers!</p>

<p>Every winter, just before spring, I always seems to pick up Pride and Prejudice and read it through in a week. I don’t really re-read books, except for this one. It’s lovely. And comforting. And it inspired me to add a little more lace to my wardrobe and tea to my afternoons.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2013/02/diy-lace-sleeve-sweatshirt/libraryandlace-1/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2013/02/libraryandlace-1-575x431.png" alt="libraryandlace-1" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/77053843596992620/">Inspired by this little pin on Pinterest</a>, I scored this $3 sweatshirt  (at Walmart) and some lace and went to work. I really LOVE how it turned out. Super simple and pretty much no sewing skills required (I literally followed the directions in the Pinterest caption). And very cozy. Perfect for reading.</p>

<p>One of my favorite spots to read is the local Public Library. It is so peaceful and has so many gorgeous windows that the place is always flooded with light, even when it’s dark and rainy like today.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2013/02/diy-lace-sleeve-sweatshirt/libraryandlace-3155/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2013/02/libraryandlace-3155-575x383.png" alt="libraryandlace-3155" /></a></p>

<p>Do you ever find yourself coming back to a certain book? Do tell!</p>

<p>{Thanks to my husband Matt for taking these photos during his study break. Straight up gentleman that one.}</p>

    <p>Can you believe it is already February? January was busy and cold and gone as quickly as it came. Since February is now here that means Valentine’s day is quickly approaching. I always liked Valentine’s day. I mean of course you should celebrate those you love everyday but having a national holiday dedicated to showing your loved ones how much they mean to you, how fun!</p>

<p>I wanted to throw together some sweet little hair accessories for my niece this Valentine’s Day and decided to make a few extra to put in the shop, <a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/SweetLittlePeonies">SweetLittlePeonies</a>. If you are looking for small treats for your little ones this Valentine’s day, consider checking out these simple and sweet petal heart bobby pins. And of course, whatever you do and whomever you decide to celebrate Valentine’s Day with, I hope your day is filled with joy and laughter and time spent with those you love most and who love you.</p>

<p>I know I’ve probably bored you to death with photos of our favorite state park, Sycamore Shoals, but I wanted to prove to you just how much we love this spot. We even brave weather in the teens with biting cold wind whipping off the river just for a joyful jaunt along the beautiful trails. It is amazing to me how beautiful this place is even in the dead of winter. Hope you all are bundled up tight and staying toasty warm this evening.</p>

<p>Today was my fourth day off from work <em>in a row</em> and I can’t even begin to explain how relaxed I feel. I am determined to make the most of every free day before classes begin again next week. The last few days have been spent enduring the daunting tasks of cleaning out the office. Since the hubster and I will be moving in the next 6 months, any opportunity to throw out junk and downsize is another step toward making the move a smooth transition.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2013/01/out-n-about-antiques/antiques/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2013/01/antiques-575x359.jpg" alt="antiques" title="antiques" /></a></p>

<p>After all that cleaning I decided it was time for a bit of town exploration so I grabbed the camera and headed to one of my favorite antique stores. After an hour of taking photos and wishing I could buy out the store, I came home and made a yummy lunch for me and the hubby, <em>Grilled Lemon Basil Tuna Wraps</em>. Next, we headed down to the river for an afternoon walk and yes, a few more photos which I will share later.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2013/01/out-n-about-antiques/antiques2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2013/01/antiques2-575x359.jpg" alt="antiques" title="antiques" /></a></p>

<p>All in all, it was a <em>glorious</em> day. Antiques, sunshine, outdoors, lunch with my hubby, what more could a gal want? Hope you all are having a splendid afternoon as well!</p>

<p>I’ve had a bit of a nesting bug lately. It seems every Christmas break I feel the need to stock up on home projects, sewing, painting, etc. This past weekend I decided to finally paint the cheap bookshelf that has been serving as extra pantry storage in my kitchen. I have a light, unfinished wood shelf on the opposite side of the kitchen so I wanted a light color for this shelf as well to keep a small space looking as open, light and roomy as possible.</p>

<p><em>BEFORE:</em></p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2013/01/kitchen-shelving-transformation-country-chic/kitchen-shelving-10/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2013/01/kitchen-shelving-10.jpg" alt="Kitchen Shelving Transformation: Country Chic" title="kitchen shelving (10)" /></a></p>

<p><em>AFTER:</em></p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2013/01/kitchen-shelving-transformation-country-chic/kitchen-shelving-8/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2013/01/Kitchen-Shelving-8.jpg" alt="Painted Kitchen Shelving" title="Kitchen Shelving (8)" /></a></p>

<p>Like I said, this was a very cheap bookshelf, the kind with the veneer covering, not real wood. I was worried I wouldn’t really be able to paint over this material but I used a primer/paint mix and although I did have to use multiple coats, it covered quite well.</p>

<p>If I were to paint this material again I would probably use a spray primer so it would cover without the brush strokes. I think this would allow better overall coverage and would also be less expensive than the primer/paint variety.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2013/01/kitchen-shelving-transformation-country-chic/kitchen-shelving-9/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2013/01/Kitchen-Shelving-9.jpg" alt="Painted Kitchen Shelving" title="Kitchen Shelving (9)" /></a></p>

<p>The baskets hold our bread, potatoes and onions since we tend to buy those in bulk. This is also a convenient way to showcase some of my favorite serving pieces without actually having to have a dinner party.</p>

<p><em>Materials:</em><br />
Primer/paint(1 qt.) from Home Depot-$14.98<br />
Wood Baskets from Michael’s-$3.00<br />
Mercury Votives from Target-$2.99</p>

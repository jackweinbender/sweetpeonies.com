    <p>Today was another Bird’s Nest workshop out at <a href="http://www.auntwillieswildflowers.com">Aunt Willie’s Wildlflowers</a>. These are just a few of the photos from the day. We ate a delicious pasta salad, rolls, and strawberry almond salad. So healthy!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/03/bird-nest-workshop/birds-nest-ws-20121-001/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/03/Birds-Nest-WS-20121-001-575x359.jpg" alt="" title="Bird's Nest WS 2012-3" /></a></p>

<p>Everything on the farm is blooming early thanks to our mild winter so there are more flowers than usual right now. This is wonderful for viewing, not so great for the upcoming wedding season. I suppose we can’t complain too much with all these beauties.</p>

<p>These handcrafted bird’s nest are the perfect table decoration for your upcoming Easter get-together. Check out how to make one for yourself and be sure to view more photos from the day over on our <a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/farm-photos/">“Farm Photos”</a> tab.</p>

<p><em>Supplies:</em></p>

<p>1 small straw wreath<br />
1 cardboard circle that matches the wreath size<br />
1 spool of paddle wire<br />
1 small bag of fake moss<br />
1 bag of two-pronged pins<br />
moss, nuts, dried flowers, lichen, and any other decoration from nature you can think of</p>

<p><em>Instructions:</em></p>

<p>1. Take your fake moss and cover the straw wreath, wrapping it loosely with paddle wire as you move around the wreath. Twist the paddle wire together once the entire wreath is covered. You really just need to make sure no straw is showing on the sides because the real moss will cover the top of the wreath.<br />
2. Using hot glue, attach the cardboard circle to the bottom of your wreath. This will keep your moss and pretties from falling through.<br />
3. Take various colors and textures of moss and fill the wreath hole and various parts of the top of your wreath. You can use as much or as little moss as you’d like for this part. One of our farm ladies today covered her entire wreath in moss and other just had little trails of moss coming out of the center and over the edges.<br />
4. Now use dried hydrangea, daffodils, dogwood, nuts, lichen, twigs, wheat, grasses and anything else you can find to decorate the rim of your nest. This year, I used blue hydrangea bunches on each side, pussy willow branches, feathers, dried pods, larkspur, and artemisia to decorate.<br />
5. Once all your decor is secured in place with pins or hot glue, drop in a few candy eggs and your bird’s nest is complete!</p>

    <p>It never ceases to amaze me how much I don’t know about life. Every day brings new challenges, new joys and new adventures. Some days it feels as though this rocky rollercoaster that we are on just won’t stop. And the funny thing is, when it does stop, or at least pauses for a moment, that’s the moment when I feel most excited for the next big drop.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/03/change-acceptance/christmas-pics-023/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/03/Christmas-Pics-023-575x426.jpg" alt="" title="Christmas Pics 023" /></a></p>

<p>The hubby and I have been married for 4 years this May and our married life, as in our dating life, is full of never-ending surprises. We have frustrating daily surprises like broken down cars and doctor bills. Yet, at the same time, we are constantly being blessed with meals to get us through finals week or an unexpected check in the mail to treat ourselves to a night out. These past four years we have come to realize time and time again just how great God is and how blessed we are in Him.</p>

<p>These past few weeks it seems everyone in our family has had to make difficult decisions and come to some unexpected conclusions (more on this soon). When this happens, my usual response is to curl up in a ball and hide under the covers. To a certain degree I could get away with this while living under my parents’ roof. However, when the roof is your own, you have to put on your big girl pants and man up. This is not the easiest of lessons to learn and I constantly feel as if my progress is in a two steps forward, one step back rhythm. However, I suppose as long as I’m moving forward in the long-run, I’m doing alright.</p>

<p>Anyways, the point is, when so much change takes place at once, it sometimes easy to lose focus and forget what’s really important. This time next year, we could be moving to one of 7 cities if the hubby gets into a PhD school. If he doesn’t get in, we can go wherever we want, which is definitely the more terrifying option for me. You want me to choose from anything I want? And… cue meltdown.</p>

<p>So, what should I be doing now? Well, the hubby will be applying to schools in the Fall and I will most likely be applying to graduate programs or jobs (or both) in those cities as well. We won’t know anything until March next year, a mere 2 months before graduation, so until then I have a few options…</p>

<p><em>Option #1:</em> Panic and overthink every possible situation that may arise.<br />
<em>Option #2:</em> Panic and curl up under the covers. (My favorite)<br />
<em>Option #3:</em> Know that the next year will continue to be a riveting rollercoaster of a ride, enjoy the ride, and trust that whatever comes next will be exhilarating, worthwhile and right.</p>

<p>Yeah, I know, number three is the winner, it sounds so simple and yet we all know it’s so much easier said than done. However, that is where I am choosing to put my focus–waiting and trusting that what is meant to be, will be, one way or another. Like I said at the beginning, I know very little about life so why waste time trying to decipher every last detail when I could be enjoying them all.</p>

<p>If you’ve made it this far, I thank you from the bottom of my heart for sticking with me through this brief hiatus from our usual postings. After a long and taxing week, writing out my scrambled thoughts has a very therapeutic effect. Perhaps you too find yourself facing unexpected changes today. If that’s the case, I encourage you to stand strong and keep pushing forward.</p>

    <p>The Milligan library held their second annual Edible Books Festival this week (<a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/04/edible-books-festival/">year #1 here</a>). My contributions included a “Holes” carrot cake made with graham crackers, coffee frosting and cinnamon as well as a “Tortoise and the Hare” watermelon turtle, complete with <em>hair</em>-get it? I crack myself up.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/03/watermelon-turtle-edible-books/watermelonturtle3/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/03/watermelonturtle3-575x382.jpg" alt="" title="watermelonturtle3" /></a></p>

<p>Anywho, I thought I’d share a few quick and dirty instructions for carving Mr. Turtle. I’ve seen several versions of this turtle but the one at <a href="http://rhondas3boys.blogspot.com/2010/06/watermelon-turtle.html">Down Memory Lane</a> is my favorite.</p>

<p><em>Instructions:</em><br />
1. Cut watermelon in half along the longer line.</p>

<p>2. Use a melon-baller, or if you don’t have one (like me) use a metal measuring spoon-1/4 tsp, and scoop out as much watermelon as possible.</p>

<p>3. Scrape all remnants of the watermelon out of each side.</p>

<p>4. Take one side of the watermelon, and draw an oval-shaped shell, four feet, and a head with a dry-erase marker (dry-erase makes it easy to wipe off once you’re done carving).</p>

<p>5. Carve out your shapes.</p>

<p>6. With a flat head screwdriver, carve out the lines on your shell. If you are afraid to eyeball it, use the dry erase marker to draw your shapes. I basically just dragged the flat edge back and forth to make the lines–took about 15 minutes total.</p>

<p>7. Poke two small holes in the head and poke in two whole peppercorns for eyes.</p>

<p>8. Use toothpicks to secure your legs and head to the shell.</p>

<p>9. All that’s left is filling the non-shell side with fruit (and adding strawberry-leaf hair if desired). I used the previously scooped melon balls, strawberries and grapes as filling.</p>

<p>This turtle is really easy to make and adds a fun element to any party.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/03/watermelon-turtle-edible-books/holes-cake/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/03/holes-cake-325x216.jpg" alt="" title="holes cake" /></a>Here’s a little shot of the carrot “Holes” cake. I basically just used a round cookie cutter to make the holes, crumbled the cake into piles and added ground-up graham crackers so it looked more textured and desert-like. I also sprinkled cinnamon into the holes and on one side of the mounds to act as a sort of shading. The “shovels” are broken wood skewers and the rocks are ginger candies.</p>

<p>Some of my other favorites from Edible Books 2012 were “Where’s Wal-dough” (cookie people with Waldo hiding among them) by Grace Jackson, “Pigs in Heaven” (a plate of bacon) by Seth and Stacey Tramel, and “Book of Fungi” with meringue mushrooms (I totally thought they were real mushrooms) by Meredith Sommers.</p>

<p>If you ever have the opportunity to bake for an Edible Books event, DO IT! It’s so much fun! I hope you’ve enjoyed this little tutorial. Let us know how your watermelons turn out. Happy carving!</p>

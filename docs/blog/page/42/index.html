    <p>If you haven’t figured it out yet, there is no method to my kitchen madness. I sort through buckets of recipes and after “getting the gist” of the ingredients needed, I just go at it. Sometimes I substitute ingredients because I’m curious, and other times simply because I don’t have an ingredient. Really, it is only through great pains and a lot of luck that I am able to produce something resembling a recipe for you each week.</p>

<p>Why am I telling you this?</p>

<p>I made this dip. It was fantastic.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/08/tomatillo-avocado-dip/beans-party-035/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/08/Beans-Party-035-575x426.jpg" alt="" title="Tomatillo &amp; Avocado Dip" /></a><br />
However, I didn’t measure all the ingredients.</p>

<p>The recipe I’ve written below should be very close to the original, but be sure to taste as you go and adjust if needed.</p>

<p>I know many of you have never used tomatillos before, but trust me they are worth the gamble. Tomatillos are delicious when mixed with the right ingredients. They are responsible for the tart flavor in many Mexican green sauces. I encourage you to give them a try and add a new ingredient to your family meals.</p>

<p><strong>Tomatillo Avocado Dip</strong></p>

<p><em>Ingredients:</em></p>

<p>2 tomatillos<br />
1 avocado<br />
1 tbsp half and half<br />
1 tbsp lemon<br />
2 tsp garlic<br />
1 tsp pepper<br />
1/2 tsp salt</p>

<p><em>Instructions:</em></p>

<p>Remove skin and pit of avocado. Chop tomatillos into smaller chunks. Combine all ingredients in a blender or food processor. Use the half and half to smooth out the dip.</p>

<p>Serve with your favorite chip or a plateful of fresh veggies and enjoy!</p>

    <p>For those of you who know me well, you know how, shall we say, “unmotivated” I am when it comes to school. It’s not that I don’t like to learn, I just like to “do” more. I am a practical application kind of gal.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/08/end-of-summerstart-of-school/chocolate-pie-quesadilla-bruschetta-lake-215/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/08/chocolate-pie-quesadilla-bruschetta-lake-215-575x381.jpg" alt="" title="ME" /></a></p>

<p>After graduating from high school, I made the “mistake” (my mother hates it when I refer to it as such) of taking a year off from school to work in Ukraine. Despite being a worthy cause, that one year of actually <strong>doing</strong> something worthwhile made going back to school to learn about doing something worthwhile much more difficult. It didn’t help that not long after my return, Jack and I were engaged and soon living in Tennessee. Before the wedding I attended a community college in order to incur as little debt as possible while working my way through a psychology degree. After moving to Tennessee and finding that very few of my credits were transferable, I decided to switch majors.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/08/end-of-summerstart-of-school/chocolate-pie-quesadilla-bruschetta-lake-161/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/08/chocolate-pie-quesadilla-bruschetta-lake-161-325x489.jpg" alt="" title="chocolate pie, quesadilla, bruschetta, lake 161" /></a></p>

<p>And here we are, present day, I am now a nursing major, not a place I ever thought I would end up. I used to picture myself as a sophisticated New York business woman carrying a leather briefcase, rocking the power suit, and running all around town with 4-inch heels. Now I am a disheveled Tennessee student carrying a 40 lb bag of nursing books, rocking my sweats, and running all around the hilly campus in my $2 flipflops.</p>

<p>Why am I giving you this snapshot of my college life? If you haven’t guessed yet, this was my first week back in class. This is the second time in my college life that I have been classified as a junior (that’s as far as I made it last time). Although I am still young I feel very old and very behind where I would like to be. When I go to class, I look across the lecture hall at the new generation of college students filing loudly into their seats, and although our ages are not too far apart, our worlds are. Their fashion choices confuse me and I constantly find that I have no knowledge of the media icons they imitate or the bands that ring out from their fancy iphones. It seems our worlds are worlds apart.</p>

<p>All of these factors contribute to my lack of motivation to be in school. However, I am officially on the downward slope, provided there are no more unexpected surprises up ahead, and attempting to constantly remind myself of that fact. Despite being a married, bill-paying, car constantly breaking down, working three jobs while going to school adult, I have successfully completed my first week back and I find myself still smiling.</p>

<nbsp>  
I believe I owe Jake much credit on the smiles. You see, Jake thought I needed to get away before the chaos began again (for him too as he continues his Master’s degree). [![](jekyll_uploads/2011/08/chocolate-pie-quesadilla-bruschetta-lake-199-325x229.jpg "Jakie")](http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/08/end-of-summerstart-of-school/chocolate-pie-quesadilla-bruschetta-lake-199/) So on Tuesday (my last day of summer), we went out to the lake at Watauga Point. It was an absolutely gorgeous day here in Tennessee and we decided to take along a picnic. After our yummy turkey sandwiches we played a grueling game of catch with our fluorescent Nerf football followed by a bit of trail exploring and finally, cooling off in the water. Of course, I wouldn’t miss an opportunity to snap a few photos to share with you all.</nbsp>

<nbsp>  
[![](jekyll_uploads/2011/08/chocolate-pie-quesadilla-bruschetta-lake-113-575x368.jpg "The Lake")](http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/08/end-of-summerstart-of-school/chocolate-pie-quesadilla-bruschetta-lake-113/)</nbsp>

<p>Suffice to say, I think our little excursion was just what we needed to rejuvenate our souls as we prepare to buckle down for another fall semester. I hope you enjoy these pictures from our day at the lake.</p>

<p>Thank you all for your continued support and encouragement. Please be patient as I attempt to figure out a posting schedule that works with my new class schedule. And be sure to keep us in your thoughts and prayers and we attempt to finish these last few semesters strong.</p>

<p>A Birthday Wish: It’s my sister’s birthday today so I just wanted to take a second to wish her the very best birthday! She is my best friend and I would be absolutely lost without her. Kendra, I hope today you are surrounded by those you love and who love you. Sending you all my love today. Happy Birthday!<br />

    <p>There’s a fun little project moving through the blogging community which asks individuals to weed through their posts and rank them. Rank my posts!?! After choosing the best post for each of the 7 categories, the individual then tags more talented bloggers to continue the thread of “7 Links.”</p>

<p>Although I have found these posts entertaining, I have secretly been hoping no one would tag me because the thought of weeding through all of my posts and only being able to choose 7 seems overwhelming to me. However, thanks to Meghan at <a href="http://scratch-made-wife.blogspot.com/">Scratch-Made Wife</a>, I am now officially a part of the 7 Links community. Don’t worry Meghan, I forgive you. Please be sure to head on over to <a href="http://scratch-made-wife.blogspot.com/">Scratch-Made Wife</a> and show her some love.</p>

<p>Without further ado, here are my 7…</p>

<p><strong>MOST BEAUTIFUL POST:</strong> <a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/06/white-wedding-bridal-luncheon/">White Wedding Bridal Luncheon</a> or to stay in the food realm…<a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/07/mini-blueberry-pies/">Mini Blueberry Pies</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/07/mini-blueberry-pies/shrimp-pizza-blueberry-pie-042/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/06/shrimp-pizza-blueberry-pie-042-325x215.jpg" alt="" title="Mini Blueberry Pies" /></a></p>

<p>Along with the recipes at The Kitchen Curtains, I post a lot of pictures from working out at <a href="www.auntwillieswildflowers.com">Aunt Willies Wildflowers</a>. So, although this project mainly emphasizes food, I couldn’t resist including one of my all-time favorite bridal luncheon posts.</p>

<p>I also included the mini blueberry pies because I just LOVE the final two pictures I settled on for this one. They are by far my favorite food-related pictures so far.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/05/gyro-pizza/gyro-pizza-peach-and-rhubarb-pie-047/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/05/Gyro-Pizza-Peach-and-Rhubarb-pie-047-325x243.jpg" alt="" title="Gyro Pizza" /></a></p>

<nbsp>  
**MOST POPULAR POST:** [Gyro Pizza](http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/05/gyro-pizza/) I couldn’t decide whether to go off of my stats or off of responses. Since I love this pizza SO much, I chose responses. I have had numerous individuals email me their praises for this recipe. It’s so simple but still so delicious.</nbsp>

<p><strong>MOST CONTROVERSIAL POST:</strong> <a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/07/saturday-baked-eggs-market/">Ramekin Baked Eggs</a> I write about food, crafts, and flowers–to be honest there isn’t much controversy there. I decided, like most food-bloggers before me, to take a different spin. I chose these baked eggs as most controversial because I feel like everyone has some personal slant on the way they like their eggs, so trying something new could stir up some deeply-rooted convictions.<br />

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/how-to-hem-jeans/hem-005/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/hem-005-325x243.jpg" alt="" title="hem 005" /></a></p>

<p><strong>MOST HELPFUL POST:</strong> <a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/how-to-hem-jeans/">How to Hem Jeans</a> This post was a no-brainer for me to choose. There are numerous ways to hem jeans and this one works. Really! I received many comments about how simple this hemming process was for the beginner seamstress.</p>

<nbsp>  
**SURPRISINGLY SUCCESSFUL POST:** [Frosted Banana Bars](http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/06/banana-bar-recipe/) I think the mere fact that they tasted great was the surprise. I love all things sweet and adding the frosting was more of a personal preference than what I thought others would enjoy. However, the feedback on this recipe was fabulous.</nbsp>

<p><strong>POST THAT DIDN”T GET THE ATTENTION IT DESERVED:</strong> <a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/02/honey-ginger-shrimp-with-rice/">Honey Ginger Shrimp with Rice</a> Granted, there is not a whole lot to this post, but it was one of my very first on The Kitchen Curtains and I was SO proud of it and my pictures but unfortunately received very little (no) feedback. <em>tear</em> Ok, I’m over it. Really.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/caribbean-shrimp-cups/food-094/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/food-094-325x243.jpg" alt="" title="Shrimp Cups" /></a><strong>POST I’M MOST PROUD OF:</strong> <a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/caribbean-shrimp-cups/">Caribbean Shrimp Cups</a> This was a very hard decision to make. I love all my posts and although I love seeing how much better they have become as we progress, I still love those first few that barely qualify as a real blog post. I also had a hard time because I feel as if the craft-related posts are some of the ones I am most proud of, like <a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/06/rosette-tote/">Rosette Tote</a> and <a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/05/15-minute-dress/">15-Minute Dress</a>. But in all matters food related, hands down the Caribbean Shrimp I most love. I love the idea, the photo, and the taste.</p>

<p>Now to pass along the 7 links love, if you have already been tagged I truly apologize.</p>

<p>Kira at <a href="http://www.kiranoblephotographyblog.com/">Kira Noble Photography</a> for her beautiful of everything from weddings to morning coffee.</p>

<p><a href="http://daydreamerdesserts.com/">DayDreamer Desserts</a> because she makes delicious looking desserts like <a href="http://daydreamerdesserts.com/2011/08/blueberry-cheesecake-martini.html/">Blueberry Cheesecake Martinis</a>.</p>

<p>Rachel at <a href="http://mynaturallyfrugalfamily.blogspot.com/">My Naturally Frugal Family</a>, because she is all about health and happiness.</p>

<p>Michelle at <a href="http://thatssomichelle.blogspot.com/">That’s So Michelle</a>, because she takes beautiful pictures of her food.</p>

<p>And finally, <a href="http://www.runs-with-spatulas.com/">Runs With Spatulas</a>, because I love the name and she posts nutrition information on all of her recipes.</p>

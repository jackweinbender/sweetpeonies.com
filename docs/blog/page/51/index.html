    <p>It is not uncommon to find myself at a complete loss in the kitchen. Every few weeks I feel as if I have hit a cooking rut. There are only so many different ways to combine the same 7 ingredients. I know the simple solution is to incorporate more ingredients, but every time I find myself at the breaking point, another idea comes along. This time, my lovely husband provided the idea, a Gyro pizza.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/05/gyro-pizza/gyro-pizza-peach-and-rhubarb-pie-047/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/05/Gyro-Pizza-Peach-and-Rhubarb-pie-047-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="Gyro Pizza" /></a></p>

<p>You see, we kind of like Gyros. Actually, that is probably the understatement of the century. We kind of LOVE Gyros! More specifically, we love Ozzy’s Gyros in the mall. Not only are the gyros delicious, but we love Ozzy’s family. In fact, we rarely go to the mall for the actual mall, we just go for the gyros.</p>

<p>So, of course, the idea of a Gyro pizza sounded genius to me. Here’s what we did to make it happen.</p>

<p><strong>Dough Ingredients:</strong></p>

<p>2 tsp. dry yeast<br />
1 c. warm water<br />
2 c. flour<br />
2 tbsp. olive oil<br />
2 tsp. white sugar<br />
1 tsp. oregano<br />
1 tsp. garlic<br />
1/2 tsp. salt<br />
1/2 tsp. thyme<br />
1/2 tsp. basil</p>

<p><strong>Dough Instructions:</strong></p>

<p>Mix yeast in water and let sit until creamy, about 10 minutes. In another bowl, combine the rest of the ingredients and mix. Add in the creamy yeast mixture and blend until dough is firm and joined.</p>

<p>Cover the ball of dough and let sit until it doubles in size, roughly 30 minutes. Mine never doubles in size, but somehow Jake is able to make it work. Basically, if it doesn’t double, you’ll have a thinner crust. Since I love thin crust, I am ok with it.</p>

<p>Once the dough has risen, roll it out into the shape of your stone and get ready to bake.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/05/gyro-pizza/gyro-pizza-peach-and-rhubarb-pie-022/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/05/Gyro-Pizza-Peach-and-Rhubarb-pie-022-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="Gyro Pizza dough" /></a></p>

<p>Next, make my Greek sauce. This is very simple and is the same one we recently used on the Greek Turkey Burgers. <a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/05/greek-turkey-burgers/">You can view instructions here</a>. Once you’ve made the sauce, coat your dough generously. Why generously? Well, aside from more being better, this tends to soak into the crust a little bit so you want to start with a healthy amount.</p>

<p>We used ground Italian sausage for our meat, mostly because it is easy and you don’t have to season it. Just open the package and crumble bits over your pizza.</p>

<p>Jack and I wanted this to taste very Gyro-ish so we decided to add the traditional veggies after baking so it would taste fresh. However, I still love the smell of baking onions so…I went ahead and added 4 stalks of green onions to the pizza before popping it in the oven. I also added half of a package of feta cheese.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/05/gyro-pizza/gyro-pizza-peach-and-rhubarb-pie-035/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/05/Gyro-Pizza-Peach-and-Rhubarb-pie-035-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="Gyro Pizza-Peach and Rhubarb pie 035" /></a></p>

<p>Bake at 350 degrees for about 30 minutes.</p>

<p>Once, your pizza is done baking, pull it out of the oven (thank you Captain Obvious) and add your freshly chopped tomato, lettuce, and sweet onion.</p>

<p>Last step, enjoy your Gyro pizza. So good.</p>

    <p>Jack and I celebrated three years of marriage on Tuesday. Woohoo! Here’s a little tidbit about year three of marriage…apparently, leather is the gift of choice for three years of marriage because it is at this point the couple realizes the durability of their relationship. I don’t know if that is true or not, but I like the sound of it. I can hear you married veterans chuckling right now, “oh newlyweds.”</p>

<p>Anyways, I was able to take the entire day off for some much-needed R&amp;R. Poor Jack still had to go in for most of the day, but I was able to catch up on a bit of cleaning and partake in a few activities I’ve been missing.</p>

<p>So, what did I do today, you ask?</p>

<p>After waking up at the delightful time of 9:30, I lazily walked into my kitchen for a cup of coffee and was greeted by a beautiful lily plant and a very sweet card from my best friend and hubby. This particular lily had three blooming flowers, one for each year of marriage. Awww.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/05/a-few-of-my-favorite-things/on-our-anniversary-2011-041/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/05/On-our-anniversary-2011-041-325x433.jpg" alt="" title="On our anniversary-2011 041" /></a></p>

<p>Next, I enjoyed a cup of coffee on our front porch and watched the morning haze wear away. Here’s a picture of our porch growing progress.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/05/a-few-of-my-favorite-things/on-our-anniversary-2011-037/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/05/On-our-anniversary-2011-037-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="On our anniversary-2011 037" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/05/a-few-of-my-favorite-things/on-our-anniversary-2011-040/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/05/On-our-anniversary-2011-040-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="On our anniversary-2011 040" /></a></p>

<p>I then walked down to the mailbox and was blessed to find five anniversary cards from our friends and family. Thank you all for the well wishes. We wouldn’t be where we are today without your love and support.</p>

<p>After a tearful read over the cards. I headed to the bank and then our local Starbucks to get coffee #2, but more importantly, to say hello to my friend Jane.</p>

<p>After a brief visit, I made the trek down the block to Target for a little “window shopping,” or at least that’s what I told myself. Just look, don’t touch, don’t buy, just look. That didn’t last long.</p>

<p>I’ve been wanting a pair of boots for the farm since last summer. These were cheap and cute enough for me to finally cave.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/05/a-few-of-my-favorite-things/on-our-anniversary-2011-033/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/05/On-our-anniversary-2011-033-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="On our anniversary-2011 033" /></a></p>

<p>I mean, just look at these beauties, aren’t they perfect for a wildflower farm? I love boots!</p>

<p>I wasn’t completely selfish, however…I bought Jakie an individual mug/french press that he’s had his eye on for months.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/05/a-few-of-my-favorite-things/mug-006/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/05/mug-006-325x454.jpg" alt="" title="mug 006" /></a></p>

<p>We decided the one thing we absolutely wanted on our anniversary was sushi. So, we headed to our local Earth Fare and bought a few varieties of sushi, artisan bread, and Tillamook cheese. Yes, we bought sushi from a store, not a restaurant. Trust me their sushi beats any restaurant in the area.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/05/a-few-of-my-favorite-things/on-our-anniversary-2011-056/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/05/On-our-anniversary-2011-056-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="On our anniversary-2011 056" /></a></p>

<p>I thought Tillamook Cheese would be a treat as well since we can’t buy normal blocks of it like we do back home. In fact, half the amount of Tillamook cheese costs double the price here in Tennessee. So, it truly was a treat.</p>

<p>We also rented a movie we’ve wanted to see since February. You ready for this? Gnomeo and Juliet.It was SO cute and my kind of clever with remarks along the lines of, “What’s in a gnome?” Yes, I am easily entertained.</p>

<p>We followed dinner with another favorite, French Silk Pie from Dairy Queen.<br />
All in all, a very enjoyable anniversary, probably my favorite so far, and all for a reasonable price. Which, for practical me, feels wonderful.</p>

<p>A fabulous day of all the things I love: coffee, friends, gardening, sushi, Tillamook Cheese, boots, French Silk Pie, and of course, Jack. And now, I am finishing the day with one last favorite, blogging. So, thank you for indulging me as I take a break from the usual crafts and recipes to bring you a few of my favorite things.</p>

    <p>Today was a great day. Instead of the isolated thunderstorms the weather man called for, today’s forecast was bright and sunny. A much-needed reprieve from the past two weeks of dreary rain, although I’ll take the rain over tornado warnings any day.</p>

<p>Aside from the beautiful weather, Jack and I were able to partake in a day of celebrations as our friend Adam graduated from a 4-year-long Master of Divinity program. Yay Adam! He will soon be attending Johns Hopkins so, ya, you could say were pretty proud to know this guy.</p>

<p>Anyways, after a fun day of friends and mocha cake, I am going to try to crank out this recipe for you. Jack and I broke out the ground turkey Thursday evening to make one of our favorite meals, Greek turkey burgers. If you are one to criticize the authenticity of food origins than you might want to stop reading now as I have no idea if this can really be considered Greek at all.</p>

<p>However, we do use Greek yogurt to make the sauce, so that’s the name I am going with.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/05/greek-turkey-burgers/turkey-burger-and-dres-044/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/05/turkey-burger-and-dres-044-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="turkey burger and dres 044" /></a></p>

<p>We have made these numerous times and this last batch was the best yet.  Just goes to show, if at first you don’t succeed…well, you know the rest.</p>

<p><strong>Turkey Burger Ingredients:</strong></p>

<p>1 package ground turkey<br />
1/4 of a large sweet onion<br />
1/4 c. mushrooms ( I think I chopped 6 or 7 mushrooms)<br />
1/4 cup bread crumbs<br />
1 egg<br />
1 package of feta cheese<br />
1 tbsp Worcestershire<br />
salt/pepper<br />
oregano<br />
garlic powder</p>

<p><strong>Turkey Burger Instructions:</strong></p>

<p>Thaw turkey. Chop mushrooms and onions.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/05/greek-turkey-burgers/turkey-burger-and-dres-005/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/05/turkey-burger-and-dres-005-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="turkey burger and dres 005" /></a></p>

<p>Combine turkey, Worcestershire, onion, and mushrooms in a large bowl. Add egg and bread crumbs.</p>

<p>If you think the mixture looks super liquidy, you either need to mix it up some more (using your hands works best), or add a few more sprinkles of bread crumbs. I added less crumbs this time and the burgers ended up super moist, which was awesome.</p>

<p>Next, add 1/2 the feta package to the mix as well as seasonings. Be generous with the seasoning, really… you can never over-season. General seasoning guidelines??? I would say add at least 1 tbsp of oregano and garlic and 1 tsp of salt and pepper. The image below has all the seasonings on top of the meat, you should also have this much seasoning.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/05/greek-turkey-burgers/turkey-burger-and-dres-009/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/05/turkey-burger-and-dres-009-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="turkey burger and dres 009" /></a></p>

<p>Form mixture into patties. You should be able to get 4-6 patties depending on the size you prefer. Cook in a pan, not on the grill to prevent any slippage through the grate.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/05/greek-turkey-burgers/turkey-burger-and-dres-014/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/05/turkey-burger-and-dres-014-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="turkey burger and dres 014" /></a></p>

<p>At the same time, you should sautee some onions in olive oil to add to the top of the burger. Trust me, it’s the right choice.</p>

<p>Now to the Greek sauce…</p>

<p><strong>Greek Sauce Ingredients:</strong></p>

<p>1 single container of Plain Greek Yogurt (in the size that costs $1)<br />
1/4 grated cucumber<br />
2 tsp. pepper<br />
1 tbsp dill<br />
1 tbsp olive oil<br />
1-2 tbsp lemon (tast it after 1 to see what you think)<br />
1-2 tsp. garlic</p>

<p><strong>Greek Sauce Instructions:</strong></p>

<p>Grate the cucumber, yes, like on a cheese grater. The end product will look something like this…</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/05/greek-turkey-burgers/turkey-burger-and-dres-019/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/05/turkey-burger-and-dres-019-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="turkey burger and dres 019" /></a></p>

<p>Combine all ingredients.Taste it as you go, you may not like as much seasoning as we do or you may want more. Either way, these amounts should be a good starting point.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/05/greek-turkey-burgers/turkey-burger-and-dres-021/"></a><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/05/greek-turkey-burgers/turkey-burger-and-dres-032/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/05/turkey-burger-and-dres-032-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="turkey burger and dres 032" /></a></p>

<p>All that’s left is to place your burger on a bun, add sauteed onions, lettuce, Greek sauce, and voila, deliciousness on a bun!</p>

<p>These are fabulous, really, truly, fabulous. Happy cooking!</p>

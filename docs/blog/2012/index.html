    <p>I didn’t grow up a vegetable-eating child, not even a semi-compliant vegetable eater. I spent many a night sitting at the table after everyone else had finished their supper staring down the grotesque stalks of broccoli and cauliflower that threatened my sensitive palate. I hated vegetables forever, and then one day, I didn’t. I tell you about my childhood vegetable woes because it is necessary if I’m to convince you that this brussel sprouts recipe is absolutely delicious!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/12/brussel-sprouts-toasted-pecans/brussel-sprouts/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/12/brussel-sprouts-575x359.jpg" alt="brussel sprouts" title="brussel sprouts" /></a></p>

<p>Yes, despite the common misconception that brussel sprouts are a child’s worst nightmare (and many adults’) these little vegetables are so tasty when cooked right. I had the pleasure of trying my first sprouts at a friends home a few weeks ago and decided I needed to attempt my own recipe.</p>

<p><em>Roasted Brussel Sprouts with Toasted Pecans</em></p>

<p>1 package brussel sprouts<br />
1/2 cup chopped pecans<br />
olive oil<br />
1-2 tbsp lemon juice<br />
2 tbsp balsamic vinegar<br />
garlic powder or 2 minced cloves<br />
pepper<br />
salt</p>

<p><em>Instructions:</em></p>

<p>Rinse sprouts and place in casserole dish (or similar). Coat generously with olive oil, balsamic vinegar &amp; lemon juice–adjust vinegar for individual taste. I cannot emphasize enough to coat the brussel sprouts well with the olive oil, this is the key to getting them cooked just right, all the way through to the middle.</p>

<p>Chop pecans and garlic (unless you use powder) and place in small oven safe dish. Place dish under broiler for 5-10 minutes, until lightly browned.</p>

<p>Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Add toasted pecans &amp; garlic to the sprouts. Add a dash of salt and about 1 tsp of pepper. Place in oven for 45 minutes to 1 hour, you want the sprouts very tender. Stir contents every 15 minutes.</p>

<p>Once sprouts are tender, broil on high for about 15 minutes until the outsides begin to char. Remove from the oven &amp; allow to cool. Serve alone as a side dish or add to a mixed-green salad with artichoke hearts.</p>

    <p>It’s beginning to look a lot like Christmas in our home and that means it’s time for one my favorite tasks-wrapping presents. Yay!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/12/christmas-gift-wrap/christmas-gift-wrap-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/12/Christmas-Gift-Wrap-2.jpg" alt="Christmas Gift Wrap" title="Christmas Gift Wrap" /></a></p>

<p>This year, I found beautiful gold &amp; red shiny gift wrap from TJ Maxx for $3. Although the gift wrap was much fancier than my typical gift wrap, I wanted to incorporate some of the simple touches that I have used in the past. I chose cards that were made of simple recycled brown cardstock and wrapped each gift in twine.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/12/christmas-gift-wrap/christmas-gift-wrap-1/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/12/Christmas-Gift-Wrap-1.jpg" alt="Christmas Gift Wrap" title="Christmas Gift Wrap (1)" /></a></p>

<p>These gifts look quite stunning under the tree this year and will hopefully be well received by friends and family.</p>

    <p>I hope each of you had a fantastic Thanksgiving holiday with your loved ones. We had the pleasure of having a family member in town this year, hooray! I always miss our family around the holidays and can’t say enough about how thankful we were to have my mom in town. Here is just a tiny glimpse at our shiny Thanksgiving table setting.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/11/table-setting-mercury-glass-blue-yellow/thanksgiving/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/11/Thanksgiving-575x359.jpg" alt="Blue &amp; Mercury Glass Table Setting" title="Thanksgiving" /></a></p>

<p>Blue China: TJ Maxx<br />
Grey Napkins: Target<br />
Yellow Raffia: Walmart<br />
Mercury Glass Votives: Target</p>

<p>This table setting was incredibly simple to put together and the mercury glass votives went a long way to making it dressy for the holiday.</p>

<p>Enjoy the rest of your Thanksgiving weekend. Happy Thanksgiving!</p>

    <p>My dear friend Laura was married at the end of September. I offered to help out by arranging her wedding flowers, a task I was a little nervous about because, as we all know, flower options become a bit more limited the farther you get into the Fall season. However, Laura was incredibly easygoing about the flowers and pretty much gave me the criteria of “I just want something pretty.”</p>

<p>The wedding was held at a little local church on a college campus, with a river running along one side–idyllic right? The reception was held just down the road at Meredith Valley Farms, this venue has some of the most beautiful views of the Tennessee hills I have ever seen. The weather was a bit stormy throughout the afternoon but you would have never known by looking at the joy on the bride and groom’s faces as well as the sheer happiness on the faces of all those in attendance.</p>

<p>Because of the simple and natural elements involved in this wedding, we decided to make the bouquets and arrangements very natural and free–everything you might think of when it comes to wildflowers. All of the flowers came from Linda’s farm, <a href="http://auntwillieswildflowers.com">Aunt Willies Wildflowers</a>.</p>

<p>Hannah Bader, a friend of mine and local photographer, served as their wedding photographer and snapped a couple of photos for me at the service. Hannah’s photography includes weddings, portraits, and events. She approaches her photography from a photo-journalistic/environmental portraiture approach. The following are just a few of the photos she took downstairs as I was finishing some final bouquet details (more photos to come).</p>

    <p>Hello friends. Let’s jump right into our third month of freezer meal schedules, grocery list and tools for planning (if you haven’t read <a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/10/freezer-meal-schedule-and-planning-2/">Freezer Meal Schedule &amp; Planning: Month #2</a>, check it out first). Our schedule for month #3 worked out to be even better than the month before. This is getting easier and easier each month because we always have a few meals leftover so I don’t have to add as many new recipes to the mix and yet we still have much variety to work with.</p>

<p>Here is the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ApU9WwQlN06CdG5HY2k5V3JyaFhMS3BGS3BsQVFuUVE">link</a> to our shopping list for this month. Our total store amount added up to $93.10. We decided we would allow an extra trip for milk each month since our freezer isn’t big enough to buy 2 gallons and freeze one. So our extra expenses for this month added up to $18 with one extra carton of eggs, milk and produce.</p>

<p>See our <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ApU9WwQlN06CdGNiajNBR2o1emV0N1JlSDNmLUZlcVE">month #3 meal schedule</a>.</p>

<p><em>Monthly Meals:</em></p>

<p><strong>Dinner:</strong></p>

<p>Chili over rice–leftover from last month (2 meals for 2)<br />
Curried Carrot Soup–leftover from last month (new batch-8 meals for 2)<br />

Burgers–leftover (2 meals for 2)<br />
Sloppy Joe Chicken Sandwiches (6 meals, new twist)<br />
Taquitos (24 individual-6 meals for 2)<br />
Potato Corn Chowder (2 meals for 2)<br />
Hawaiian Chicken and Carrot slaw (8 meals for 2)<br />
Spaghetti (5 meals for 2)<br />
Baked Potatoes (5 lb bag, about 8 meals for 2)</p>

<p><strong>Sides:</strong></p>

<p>Oriental Chicken Salad<br />
Homemade Cornbread<br />
Rice</p>

<p><strong>Lunches:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Snacks:</strong></p>

<p>Bananas<br />
Apples<br />
Yogurt<br />
Grapes</p>

<p><strong>Sweet Sloppy Joe Chicken:</strong></p>

<p>I used the same <a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/10/freezer-meal-schedule-and-planning-2/#sweet-sloppy">sweet &amp; sloppy joe chicken recipe</a> as last month but we decided to use a rotisserie chicken at Ingles since they were on sale for $4.89 instead of chicken breasts. The rotisserie chicken proved to be a bit less expensive and yielded the same amount of chicken as the chicken breasts. Click link above to see recipe at “Freezer Meal Schedule &amp; Planning: Month #2″ post.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/09/lower-your-grocery-bill-monthly-meals-part-2/#carrot-soup" title="Lower Your Grocery Bill &amp; Monthly Meals (Part 2)">Curried Carrot Soup:</a></strong></p>

<p>I cooked up a double portion of our curried carrot soup this month because, well, it’s delicious! Click the link above to see our recipe.</p>

<p><strong>Taquitos:</strong></p>

<p>Since I used the last of the shredded beef in last month’s taquitos, I decided to go for simple rice and bean taquitos this month. We used brown rice, kidney beans, green onions, cilantro and a bit of cheddar cheese to fill the tortillas along with a sprinkling of adobe powder and pepper.</p>

<p>We bought a 40-pack of small flour tortillas, which were $.05 cheaper/unit than smaller amount packages.</p>

<p><strong>Hawaiian Chicken &amp; Carrot Slaw:</strong></p>

<p>We bought our usual large package of chicken breasts and a bottle of Hawaiian marinade. When we get home from the store, we always cut the chicken into 8 oz portions (4 oz = 1 single serving). This makes it easy to quickly thaw a bag for dinner. You can choose to marinade the chicken before freezing or after it thaws.</p>

<p>Warm up your pan and get your chicken cooking. Now peel one large carrot with a potato peeler. Then chop your shavings into smaller pieces and combine in a bowl with chopped sweet onion, a dash of pepper and garlic, 1 tsp balsamic vinegar and a dash of red wine vinegar. Combine, chicken, carrot slaw, and rice in your tortillas and enjoy!</p>

<p>I love this recipe, it tastes very light, flavorful and fresh. We used the leftover tortillas from our 40-pack that was bought for taquitos. Ours lasted all month long but they freeze well too if you are worried about them staying fresh.</p>

<p><strong>Spaghetti:</strong></p>

<p>Kielbasa was on sale this month so we changed up our usual spaghetti recipe (which uses ground sausage) and substituted kielbasa. Yummy! I purchased some pasta noodles, diced tomatoes and tomato paste last month when it was on sale so I thought I should use up those items this month. Of course, I recommend sticking with what you know best and use your favorite spaghetti recipe. Divide the sauce into meal-sized baggies to freeze and when you’re ready for spaghetti, just thaw your sauce and cook up the noodles. My recipe yielded 12 cups of sauce.</p>

<p><strong>Cornbread:</strong></p>

<p>Simple and quick <a href="http://allrecipes.com/recipe/golden-sweet-cornbread/detail.aspx">golden sweet cornbread recipe from all recipes</a>. We poured our batter into muffin pans, which left us with 12 large cornbread muffins.</p>

<p><strong>Snacks:</strong></p>

<p>For our snacks this month, we tried to eat the bananas first, as they expire more quickly, the apples last us pretty much all month long. Yogurt Jack can space out with his lunches for about 3 weeks. The grapes, we separated into individual baggies and froze to be eaten later. They taste just as wonderful when you pull them back out.</p>

    <p>Hello Friends! I have two months of freezer meals, schedules and recipes to share with you today. You can link directly to <a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/10/freezer-meal-schedule-and-planning/">Freezer Meal Schedule &amp; Planning: Month #3</a> here.</p>

<p>Our second month of once-a-month-shopping and freezer meals was a little haphazard due to my lack of diligent planning on the front-end with meals, however, we made it through the month with only one extra trip to the store for a special dinner we hosted for a couple of friends. At the end of <a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/09/lower-your-grocery-bill-monthly-meals-part-2/" title="Lower Your Grocery Bill &amp; Monthly Meals (Part 2)">Freezer Meals: Month #1</a> we still had about six burger meals leftover, four carrot soups, and five servings of chili. Those meals were then incorporated into the next month’s meal schedule.</p>

<p>Here is a link to my groceries for <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ApU9WwQlN06CdEZKaVpkeGk4UGVhamJCRTBKOFZEdEE">month #2</a>. I only included the food groceries for a general guideline and left off the detergents, lunch baggies, etc. There weren’t as many BOGO deals at Ingles this month but I took advantage of some of their discounts on chicken broth, kitchen bags and tomato sauces for the following month. Our total grocery store trip (between two stores) cost $102.47. Throughout the month, we also spent $12 more at the produce stand down the street.</p>

<p><em>Month #2 Meals:</em></p>

<p><strong>Dinner:</strong><br />
Chili over rice–leftover from last month (5 meals for 2)<br />

<p>Check out our <a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/09/lower-your-grocery-bill-monthly-meals-part-2/">first month of freezer meals</a> for recipes that were re-made or leftover (carrot soup, roasted red potatoes, homemade dinner rolls, Chili)</p>

<p><strong>Grilled Corn and Potato Chowder:</strong></p>

<p>Since the weather was starting to cool down a bit, we decided to make another soup, and this time a bit heartier one. We chose this <a href="http://www.myrecipes.com/recipe/grilled-corn-potato-chowder-10000001918508/">grilled corn and potato chowder</a> from MyRecipes–it is awesome! I was a bit skeptical, especially as I was making a corn paste with our food processor, but it is really a treat. We ended up adding in more of the corn paste, because it added such a good flavor, and a bit more milk (1%). I did not use fresh thyme, just the ol’ dried stuff, and instead of actual corn ears, I used canned (cause it’s what I had) and grilled it with salt and red pepper before throwing into the food processor.</p>

<p><strong>Taquitos:</strong></p>

<p>We also bought a package of those mini flour tortillas, great for making taquitos. I pulled out my last bag of plain shredded beef from a roast we made last year and placed rice, beans onion, and the shredded beef into the tortillas, rolled them and lined them up in a casserole dish to freeze. Every time we wanted taquitos, we simply pulled out the dish, broke off four taquitos and baked them in the oven for about 35 minutes. We typically ate these with a side of rice and a salad. I used about 3 cups of shredded beef and 3 cups of rice and 2 cup of beans to make 24 taquitos (we adjusted this for the next month if you don’t want to use the meat).</p>

<p>Our last addition to month #2 of freezer meals was an experiment by me for sloppy joe chicken. I love normal sloppy joes, minus the grease and I wanted to at least pretend I was making a slightly healthier version by using chicken (we really like our chicken). I basically just started throwing things together to see what I could come up with and this sweet &amp; sloppy sauce hits the spot every time. Seriously, it’s our favorite meal now, and yes, we continued it into the next month.</p>

<p><a id="sweet-sloppy"></a><strong>Sweet &amp; Sloppy Joe Chicken:</strong></p>

<p>4 large chicken breasts<br />
2 cups ketchup<br />
2 tbsp Worchsetershire<br />
2 tbsp balsamic vinegar<br />
1 tbsp red wine vinegar<br />
3 tbsp brown sugar<br />
1 tsp ground mustard<br />
1 tsp pepper<br />
2 tsp garlic powder<br />
salt</p>

<p>Since it was our first attempt at this sauce we started off with a small batch and only used four large chicken breasts (the next month we tried it with one rotisserie chicken from the store ($4 and same amount of meals). Put the chicken in the crockpot, let it cook through, add the rest of the ingredients, allow to cook on low in the crockpot for one hour. Voila, sweet and sloppy chicken. We toasted wheat hamburger buns and piled on the sloppy joe chicken.</p>

    <p>A couple weekends ago I attended a baby shower for the most stylish mom-to-be I have ever known. Seriously, she’s so classy I wish I was her. Anyways, the invitation I received asked if I would contribute a children’s book for story time, I decided to continue the story time theme and also make her baby girl this pretty quilt to snuggle into while mom reads her favorite tales.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/10/babys-storytime-quilt/simple-strip-baby-quilt-6/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/10/simple-strip-baby-quilt-6-575x382.jpg" alt="" title="simple strip baby quilt (6)" /></a></p>

<p>This little quilt was very simple as it was my first and didn’t take much time to piece together as I stuck with simple strips instead of squares. I cut 2 pieces of fabric the size of my large rubber cutting mat (a simple and easy measurement to make). I also cut one piece of batting the same size. Next I took one of the pieces of fabric and cut it into 4-1/2 in. strips.</p>

<p>Once all my cutting was complete, I placed two strips together, right sides facing each other and sewed up the one long side, 1/4 in. from the edge. I unfolded those two strips and aligned a third strip next to the second strip, once again with right sides facing each other and sewed 1/4 in. in from the edge. Now unfolded, I have three connected strips of fabric. Continue to join strips until all are combined into one piece. Iron flat.</p>

<p>Place a piece of batting on the wrong side of the pieced together square of fabric. Pin together. Now sew along the lines that join each individual strip of fabric. This is how we are going to get a quilted look (see below).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/10/babys-storytime-quilt/simple-strip-baby-quilt-4/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/10/simple-strip-baby-quilt-4-575x382.jpg" alt="batting sew lines" title="simple strip baby quilt (4)" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/10/babys-storytime-quilt/simple-strip-baby-quilt-5/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/10/simple-strip-baby-quilt-5-575x382.jpg" alt="" title="simple strip baby quilt (5)" /></a></p>

<p>Once you have sewn down all the lines, lay the untouched piece of fabric (the back piece with no stitching) right side up, then place the pieced-together fabric with batting right side down (batting up). So the batting is on top, attached to the wrong side of the front of the quilt and the right side of the front of the quilt is facing down and touching the right side of the back of the quilt. Confused yet?</p>

<p>Now pin the pieces together. Your top piece will most likely be a bit smaller than the other two pieces so once pinned, take your rotary cutter and trim the edges to match the size of the top piece. Now comes the sewing. Sew around all 4 edges of the fabric pieces, leaving a 4-5 in. opening on one of the long sides. Make sure you capture all the layers as you sew around the quilt.</p>

<p>Now, reach into the opening and pull the opposite corners through the slit, essentially turning your blanket inside out or in reality, right side out. Once this is done. Iron all the edges and iron under the small section that was left open. Sew a 1/4 in. from the edge all the way around the blanket making sure to catch the fabric at the opening in your sew line (see below).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/10/babys-storytime-quilt/simple-strip-baby-quilt-1/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/10/simple-strip-baby-quilt-1-575x373.jpg" alt="quilted edges" title="simple strip baby quilt (1)" /></a></p>

<p>That’s it. You should now have a very sweet little baby quilt. Now that you have the general idea you can make another attempt and add ribbon along the edges, switch up the fabric strip patterns and textures, or switch to squares instead of strips. Good luck!</p>

    <p>During my two week hiatus from posting, Jack and I have been very busy baking 300 cookies, arranging wedding flowers, attending baby showers, and attempting to stay afloat with school and work. Yesterday my friend Laura was married at <a href="http://www.meredithvalleyfarm.com/">Meredith Valley Farms</a>. This farm is seriously so so beautiful. They have small cabins you can rent down on the river and a beautiful large cabin up on the hill for wedding guests to rent during the event weekend. And of course, the views are stunning.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/09/farmstyle-wedding-corsage/rustic-wildflower-corsage-1/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/09/rustic-wildflower-corsage-1-575x382.jpg" alt="rustic wildflower corsage" title="rustic wildflower corsage (1)" /></a></p>

<p>I arranged the flowers for Laura’s wedding. You would think there would not be many flowers to work with for an end of September wedding but even I was pleasantly surprised at the variety of colors still available on the farm. Laura wanted a very “wildflower” look to her arrangements and I think we accomplished just that. I will be posting more pictures of the bouquets soon but for now I thought I would share one of the 22 boutonnieres and corsages that I made for the event.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/09/farmstyle-wedding-corsage/rustic-wildflower-corsage-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/09/rustic-wildflower-corsage-2-325x488.jpg" alt="rustic wildflower corsage" title="rustic wildflower corsage (2)" /></a></p>

<p>This corsage was for the mothers of the bride and groom. Included in the corsage is a small dahlia, purple sage, goldenrod, dusty miller, sedum and a little weed. I tied all the corsages, bouts, and bouquets with yellow raffia to continue the rustic wildflower theme.</p>

    <p>I hope you enjoyed <a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/09/lower-your-grocery-bill-monthly-shopping-part-1/">Lowering Your Grocery Bill Part 1</a> of tips to lowering your grocery bill and preparing monthly meals. Today I am going to show you a sample meal plan with various recipes.</p>

<p>I mentioned in our first post that you should prepare your meals on a different day than your shopping day. We shop on Friday evenings when people are out painting the town red, this allows us to come home, put away groceries, soak beans, relax and then start fresh on Saturday morning. Prior to preparing your meals look at all of your recipes to consolidate prep time. If more than one recipe requires onions, then by all means, chop all of the onions at the same time. Trust me, this will save you oodles of time. Also, look for alternate cooking methods–if you have two items that can be baked at the same temp, prepare them first, put them in together, and move on to the next meal while they cook. You can also throw lots and lots of meals in a crockpot (chili!) while others are cooking in the oven.</p>

<p><strong>Month #1</strong></p>

<p><em>Dinners:</em><br />
Roasted Red Potatoes, sauteed onions &amp; salad<br />
Chili over rice (don’t knock it til you’ve tried it)<br />
Curried Carrot Soup<br />
Grilled Eggplant Tomato Aioli Sandwiches<br />
Grilled Chicken Salad<br />
Chicken and Rice (with a variety of marinades &amp; seasonings)<br />
Burgers<br />
Jerk Chicken Sandwiches<br />
Frittatas</p>

<p><em>Sides:</em><br />
Salad with tomatoes, cucumbers, onion, pine nuts<br />
Grilled Zucchini or zucchini salad<br />
Red potatoes (smaller portion than the dinner potatoes)<br />
dinner rolls<br />
corn on the cob</p>

<p><em>Lunches:</em><br />
PB&amp;J<br />
Tuna Sandwiches<br />
Our favorite Rice and Beans with salad<br />
yogurt<br />
granola</p>

<p><em>Breakfast:</em><br />
Toast<br />
Eggs<br />
Homemade granola</p>

<p>Here are some of the recipes I used and the ways I’ve adapted them to keep costs low. Although the recipes are simple you can mix them up quite a bit with different seasonings and by mixing up the paired sides. Also, most of my seasoning is done by taste and I am not shy at all with adding seasonings especially when it comes to garlic and curry so be generous, I’ll try to keep track of my amounts when these items come back into our rotation.</p>

<p><strong>Dinners:</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/09/lower-your-grocery-bill-monthly-meals-part-2/freezer-meals-monthly-shopping-7-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/09/freezer-meals-monthly-shopping-71-325x216.jpg" alt="carrot soup" title="carrot soup" /></a><a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/rachael-ray/curried-carrot-soup-recipe/index.html"><strong>Curried Carrot Soup:</strong></a><br />
<em>Adapted to save money From Rachael Ray<br />
12 servings/6 meals<br />
(6 ziplocks filled with 2 c. each)</em></p>

<p>I used Rachael Ray’s recipe as a guideline for making a cheaper version of the soup. Since I was making a lot of soup (ended up being 12 individual meals), I used 1 whole bag of the giant carrots instead of the baby carrots, 1/2 stick of butter, 2 tbsp. olive oil, 1-1/2 onions (chopped), salt to taste, cayenne pepper to taste, curry to taste (lots and lots of curry–don’t be shy). I also added 3 tbsps of honey to sweeten it a bit and break up the heavy carrot taste, you can probably just use a 2 tbsp or so of regular sugar for this. Last change was cutting out the sour cream to keep it healthier. Also, these soups always seem a bit thicker after thawing them so Jack and I will add water, milk or cream to them to make it more soupy and give us a bit more per serving.</p>

<p><strong>Roasted Red Potatoes:</strong><br />
<em>Makes about 7 meals for 2, 1-5lb bag)<br />
2-3 potatoes/person x 7</em></p>

<p>Jack and I wing this recipe every time. We ended up cutting 2-3 red potatoes into smaller cubes drizzle with olive oil, sprinkle with garlic, rosemary, pepper and a dash of salt. Toss potatoes to make sure they are thoroughly coated. Place in skillet, we use our cast-iron, place in oven at 350 degrees until they brown. Turn potatoes every 10 minutes to heat evenly and prevent burning. Pair with a larger portion of salad and veggies.</p>

<p>Also, did you know that according to food regulations, the bagged produce (like potatoes and onions) must weight at least what it says on the bag? Apparently this means that may times, distributors will throw in extra potatoes just to make sure they exceed the listed poundage. How does this help lower your grocery costs? If you weigh your bagged veggies, like onions and potatoes, you can end up with more bulk for your buck since the bags are a set price. Pretty neat, right?</p>

<p><strong>Chili:</strong><br />
<em>20 serv./10 meals<br />
(10 ziplocks filled with 2 c. each)</em></p>

<p>My chili recipe changes each month depending on spices and what not but typically it takes 1 bag of beans (kidney, black or pinto–we like kidney best). Yes, I said <em>bag</em>, meaning you must soak them overnight or attempt the quick-soak method which requires bringing the beans to a boil then letting them sit in the water for 1 hour before cooking. I quick soak when we get back from the store and then throw them in the crockpot, cover with water and let cook overnight. In the morning, I brown 1 lb of ground beef and toss it into the crockpot along with lots of onions, chili powder, garlic, a little cumin, some tomato sauce (small can), 2 small tomatoes, Worcestershire and my favorite part of our chili recipe–<em>cocoa powder</em>! Seriously, this is the best discovery of my cooking life thus far. The cocoa gives the chili such an incredible savory taste. If your chili tastes too tomato-y, add brown sugar and Worcestershire to balance it out. I’ll be making a fresh batch next month and will write down my steps to share with you all. For now, don’t be afraid to use your favorite chili recipe. The main money saver is buying bagged beans, purcasing your produce from a produce stand or farmer’s market, making do with what you have on hand and limiting fancy ingredients.</p>

<p>Now, I must admit, we have a bit of a leg-up in the meat department. We buy local grass-fed beef once a year, and I work on the farm that we buy it from in the summer so that is extra money I don’t have to factor into my monthly totals (not that it would increase it too much). Just be aware this will raise your monthly amount a bit more than ours. However, if you are able to find some, I highly recommend buying grass-fed beef locally–it’s delicious! We buy about 30lbs and it lasts us the entire year, so we don’t actually eat very much beef.</p>

<p><strong>Burgers:</strong><br />
<em>Makes 10 burger patties</em></p>

<p>Since we have ground beef on hand it seems a shame to not make a round of tasty burgers. I hate preparing burgers for just one night, it’s a lot dirty work for just the two of us. I decided to see how well I could freeze these guys. I broke out 2 lbs of beef and added 1 chopped onion, about 1 cup of bread crumbs (depends on how juicy your meat is), garlic powder, pepper, 3 tbsp Worcestershire, basil and a touch of salt.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/09/lower-your-grocery-bill-monthly-meals-part-2/dsc_0013-5/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/09/DSC_0013-325x216.jpg" alt="Perfect Burger Patties" title="Perfect Burger Patties" /></a>Next, I made perfectly round patties by placing a large round cookie cutter onto wax paper and pressing the meat mixture into the cookie cutter as a mold which when lifted up, reveals a perfectly round patty. Yes, I like consistency <em>that</em> much. I experimented and wrapped some of the patties in foil then in saran wrap and some just in a healthy layer of saran wrap. Both seemed to keep well in the freezer. The 2 lbs made 10 burgers that we then paired with $.20 corn cobs from the produce stand down the road.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/09/lower-your-grocery-bill-monthly-meals-part-2/egg-tomato-eggplant-sandwich-2-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/09/Egg-tomato-eggplant-sandwich-2-325x231.jpg" alt="Egg, tomato, eggplant sandwich" title="Egg, tomato, eggplant sandwich" /></a><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/08/grilled-eggplant-tomato-aioli-sandwiches/"><strong>Eggplant, Tomato, Aioli Sandwiches:</strong></a><br />
<em>2 sandwiches/eggplant</em></p>

<p>I have already written an entire post on these bad boys. They are SO SO SO delicious. My favorite nights of the month are our hot sandwiches. Once again, be creative! There are so many different ways to combine your simple foods that turn them into favorite family recipes.</p>

<p><strong>Chicken:</strong><br />
<em>1 large package yields roughly 10 baggies for 2 people</em></p>

<p>We eat quite a bit of chicken but we have learned how to combine well with other sides to make it stretch. First of all, we almost always buy our chicken at Walmart, the large 5 breast packages, and usually when it is $.99/lb. We buy boneless, skinless breasts but there are other things like drumsticks and what not that you can buy cheaper if that is more your style. The reason we stick to breasts is because of their versatility.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/09/lower-your-grocery-bill-monthly-meals-part-2/freezer-meals-monthly-shopping-4-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/09/freezer-meals-monthly-shopping-41-325x216.jpg" alt="chicken portions" title="chicken portions" /></a>The only other prep task you might see us doing the same night of our grocery run is cutting up our chicken and placing it into smaller baggies. We slice the breast in half thickness-wise (so it’s half as thick making it a quick thaw) then cut into strips and place 2 serving sizes (3-4 oz–it’s a small handful) in one ziplock baggie. To give you an idea, Jack and I usually get about 10-12 baggies of cut-up chicken out of 1 large package of chicken.</p>

<p>Now you have chicken in meal bags ready to freeze. We typically pull out one bag of chicken/meal, thaw and cook to go on a salad or with rice. We also give variety to our chicken meals by adding marinades to the chicken prior to cooking or experimenting with the seasoning. One of my favorite ways to cook chicken is to sprinkle it with Salad Supreme, pepper and garlic, saute onions and serve with rice. Our first month we also ate <strong>Jerk Chicken sandwiches</strong>, where we simply pulled the chicken out, poured caribbean jerk sauce into the bag while it thawed, cooked the chicken and served on a burger bun kind of like a sloppy joe but with lettuce, tomato and onion. Delicious!</p>

<p>Since the chicken makes many loose bags in the freezer we store it in what used to be our ice bin. The bin seems to be the perfect size for a full month of chicken baggies.</p>

<p><strong>Frittatas:</strong><br />
<em>4-5 eggs/1 large frittata</em></p>

<p>Eggs are pretty stinking cheap around here. We buy ours at the little produce stand down the road for $.99/dz and since it’s at the produce stand we allow ourselves to buy it more than once a month. Jack eats one egg pretty much every morning but we have also incorporated eggs into our evening meals (the open-faced sandwiches and frittatas). The frittata ends up being about $2/meal for two people so it is great on the wallet. This is basically like scrambling eggs with veggies but here’s how we make it: Cut up some veggies (onion, green pepper, tomatoes) and sautee in olive oil in a medium-sized saucepan, season with garlic, curry, pepper and a little bit of salt. Whisk together 4-5 eggs in a separate bowl with about 1 tbsp of milk. Once the veggies are ready, spread them evenly around the bottom of the pan and pour the egg mixture over the top. Your eggs should fill all the space around the veggies and just barely reach the top of the veggies (so basically, you want to still see your veggies sticking out in various places, don’t cover them like a soup). Sprinkle the eggs with a bit more seasoning and place a lid over the pan and let cook for about 20 minutes. The eggs should fluff up nicely and create a little egg pie–kind of a quiche-like consistency without the crust. Cut into the middle to make sure your eggs are cooked all the way through. Pull out of the oven, allow to cool and serve with toast.</p>

<p><strong>Sides:</strong></p>

<p>I’m not sure I need much explanation on our sides. But here’s a quick overview:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/09/lower-your-grocery-bill-monthly-meals-part-2/dsc_0037/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/09/DSC_0037-325x216.jpg" alt="salad" title="salad" /></a><strong>Salads</strong>–just like any salad, we make do with what veggies we have on hand. Sometimes that can include many ingredients (cheese, cucumber, tomatoes, oriental noodles, onions, pine nuts, hard-boiled eggs) and other times we just use the last bits of produce in the house which may just be onion and tomato. Sometimes we buy salad dressing if it is on sale but often we make individual portions of dressing to go on our salad. This dressing is a mixture of balsamic vinegar(2 tbsp), olive oil(2tbsp), lemon juice (1/2-1tbsp), garlic powder and pepper. We just combine these until we’ve reached the right amount of zing.</p>

<p>The <strong>red potatoes</strong> we cook just like the dinner version but we usually just need 1/person, so it’s a smaller batch.</p>

<p><strong>Grilled zucchini</strong>–cook however you normally would. We drizzle in olive oil with garlic and pepper sprinkled on top and place on the grill. We also grill it on skewers with peppers and onions.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/09/lower-your-grocery-bill-monthly-meals-part-2/dsc_0023/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/09/DSC_0023-325x240.jpg" alt="Zucchini Ribbon Salad" title="Zucchini Ribbon Salad" /></a><strong>Zucchini Ribbon Salad</strong>–Using a potato peeler, peel the zucchini in long ribbons and place in a bowl. Chop 1/2 of an onion and add to the bowl along with pepper and garlic (can you tell I like these two seasonings?). Prepare the balsamic/olive oil dressing listed above under “salads” and pour on top. I also usually have a package of pine nuts on hand for when I make pesto so I sprinkle those on top of this salad for a little added crunch. A small package of pine nuts costs about $2.38.</p>

<p><strong>Corn and other veggies</strong>– just grill as you normally would. This veggie item varies according to which produce is the best price and better quality.</p>

<p><strong>Lunch:</strong></p>

<p>Obviously sandwiches need little explanation but Jack’s favorite lunch meal, <strong>seasoned rice and beans</strong>, is so stinkin’ simple, I wonder sometimes why he loves it so.</p>

<p>On Sunday evenings I usually cook a small batch of brown rice (1-2 cups), pull out some extra beans that I’ve already cooked and put in the freezer and put about 1/2 cup of each into a lunch container. I also add a little pepper, salt and garlic along with a little chopped onion and tomato. In the other half of his lunch I chop up some lettuce and veggies and voila! A warm and healthy lunch for him to enjoy and it took me all of 10 minutes to throw together three for the week. Sometimes I’ll shred some cheese to go on the rice and beans, other times, if we’ve found tortillas on sale that month, I’ll give him a tortilla to wrap the mixture into, just to give a little bit of variety. Of course, he likes his staples and still swears the simple rice and beans mixture is his favorite lunch item.</p>

<p>Jack also makes<a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/03/granola-trail-mix/"> <strong>homemade granola</strong></a> to eat with yogurt for snacks or lunches.</p>

<p>Here is a link to <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ApU9WwQlN06CdGl1akNXd2NZM29kV3BTS1VsdGRrS2c"><strong>my grocery list from month #1</strong></a>. Keep in mind, I chose my menu recipes based on some of the ingredients already in my home. This is <em>very important</em> to keeping your grocery bill low. It takes a few extra minutes to take inventory of your fridge, freezer and cupboards but it lowers the cost tremendously. Google Recipes can come in handy here if you don’t yet have staple meals for various recipes. You can go to Google and type in “chili recipes” then over on the left column click the items you already have and see what links appear that use those items. From there figure out what else you would need from the store to make that recipe. This was very helpful when I wanted to find a carrot soup recipe.</p>

<p>Anyways, I say all that to inform you that if the item is not on my grocery list but I listed it above in my recipe instructions, I already had that item at the house. In month #1 this mostly pertains to seasonings. Also, although throughout the month we buy our produce at various farmer’s markets and the local produce stand, our first trip of the month we tend to buy the bulk produce and maybe a few other items if needed at the store.</p>

<p>Ok, I think that is plenty of information for you all to process. Keep in mind this was my very first month of monthly meal planning so, now looking back, the meals are terribly exciting but they tasted good and worked well throughout the entire month. We even had leftovers of some of these items to use in month #2 which helped break up the meal routine.</p>

<p>As always, let me know if you have any questions at all or if anything is unclear. Good luck!</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/09/lower-your-grocery-bill-monthly-shopping-part-1/dsc_0008-4/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/09/DSC_0008-325x201.jpg" alt="lower grocery bill" title="lower grocery bill" /></a>This past year Jack and I have picked up the speed on our ongoing money-saving mission. Although we don’t make very much money (we each work a normal job, an odd job for extra cash, and go to school full time), we have figured out where we can scrimp and scrape without robbing all the fun out of our lives. Despite bringing in very little money each month we are able to continually put money into savings and still afford a few niceties from time to time. We are not one of those insanely strict couples who never ever strays from the plan because, let’s face it, some days you just need a cheeseburger, but we do try to abide by our little rule set as closely as possible. However, allowing ourselves the flexibility to say, “screw the plan, we need a night out,” has actually given us motivation to stick to our budgeting strategy more consistently.</p>

<p>Now, this post is not meant to be a long lesson on how to save money and budget well, although I may be sharing some of our strategies and tracking sheets eventually. No, I tell you all this to say that our latest step in the long process of living simply and saving money one small piece at a time is to cut down our grocery bill. We don’t spend a lot of money on groceries, especially with just two of us, but we had been noticing that those unexpected mini trips to the grocery store throughout the month were causing the bill to be much higher than necessary. That realization is all it took for me to start researching–have I mentioned how much I enjoy researching? If you don’t believe me you will with this next bit of news…I ordered a book from the library that solely discussed lowering your grocery bill. Let me further emphasize to you how much I enjoy researching, this book was 300 pages long and I read every single page <em>and</em> loved every minute! The book I chose was, “Cut Your Grocery Bill in Half with America’s Cheapest Family.” It was awesome! At first I didn’t think I would actually learn anything because I constantly read about cheap and healthy eating on blogs and I think Jack and I have learned a great deal about saving on groceries but trust me, if you think you know cheap grocery shopping, think again.</p>

<p>Although many methods of saving are presented in this book, you can choose to use just one or combine many of their strategies, for instance, I refuse to cut coupons so I disregarded that chapter of saving tips. The one strategy that has made the biggest impact on our grocery bill is once-a-month shopping. This was/is very appealing to Jack and I and our current lifestyle. Last year was our most difficult school-wise, we both had very full class loads plus work and we felt like we were losing our minds much of the time. Luckily though, I had the idea to make a bunch of freezer meals we could thaw to save time cooking once or twice a week. This idea of once-a-month shopping takes my random amount of freezer meals to an entirely different level. Shopping once a month can seem like a daunting task, but if you check into it with an open mind, I believe you’ll agree it saves time, energy, money and effort.</p>

<p>Last month we spent $90 at the grocery store and $14 in produce for the entire month. Keep in mind this is just for two people but still, with all of our extra trips we were spending about $100 more than that.</p>

<p>The idea with this once-a-month shopping trip is to stock up on items that are on sale and that complement what you already have in your cabinets and fridge. Once you decide what you have to work with, choose a few recipes(6 to 8). You want your recipes to be simple and freezable. Of course, if every single meal is frozen you may find yourself lacking in produce. Jack and I, remedy this by adding a side (salad, rice, red potatoes, or grilled veggies) to every meal. We also have one night a week where we make some sort of breakfast meal, usually something with eggs–<a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/08/grilled-eggplant-tomato-aioli-sandwiches/">eggplant, egg &amp; aioli sandwiches</a> or frittatas. This month we also added BLTs to our weekly mix because turkey bacon was BOGO at Ingles, so for $2.38 we bought 2 packages of turkey bacon (12 slices in each), one is in the fridge and one the freezer for later in the month. Be creative with your recipe selection, although a large portion of your food will reside in the freezer, there are many other ways to incorporate fresh vegetables and other ingredients that won’t break the bank.</p>

<p>The next step is to write a menu for the month (this is the trickier part). Once you’ve chosen your recipes see how many portions each will make and how many meals this will actually amount to for your family. If you made a fabulous vegetable soup that contains 8-1 cup servings, you can scoop 2 cups into a baggie, flatten, freeze and have 4 meals ready to go for 2 people (remember you are pairing this with salad and perhaps a roll, so 1 cup is a normal serving size). Not all recipes end up having exceptional accuracy on serving size so I’ve now reached a point where I make my final monthly menu (actually write the meals on each day of the month) <em>after</em> I’ve cooked everything and seen how many meals it made.</p>

<p>Now that I’ve touched on writing a menu, let me take a moment to address keeping your produce fresh. Shopping once a month has taken a little bit of the variety out of our produce, for instance I don’t experiment too much with the fruits &amp; vegetables we buy and basically just stick to apples and bananas to pair with our lunches. Other great fruits and vegetables that seem to last longer include grapes, carrots, oranges, celery, red potatoes, sweet potatoes, &amp; zucchini. However, you are still able to incorporate those shorter-shelf-life fruits and veggies as long as you plan your menus well. If you buy avocados, buy some that aren’t quite ripe so you can hang on to them a few more days. If you need them to hurry up and ripen, toss them in a paper bag for the afternoon and they’ll ripen up quickly. If you buy them ripe, plan your meal so that you use those items in your first week of meals. Since we buy produce about twice a month, our 1st and 3rd weeks typically have more fresh veggies incorporated into the meals but that is not to say the week 2 and 4 are lacking, it’s just a different type of produce. Make sense? Back to our shopping steps.</p>

<p>Now, of course, you need to go to the store (or brave it before menu writing but after choosing your recipes). We go to 2 stores now. The week that we end up buying food, instead of giving in to the idea of coupon-ing (I just won’t devote that much time), we buy a Sunday paper and look at which store has the most deals with their “club card” that fits the most items on my shopping list. For instance, this month Ingles had about 75% of the items on my list (or some version of them–be flexible!) on sale and most of those were BOGO. We went there first and I purchased the sale items only, then I brought along last month’s receipt from Walmart and checked some of our staple items to see how their prices compared. If the staple item was cheaper than what Walmart had listed last month than I bought it at Ingles, if not, I head over to Wally World and purchase the item there instead. So yes, two stores in one night, it sounds crazy but it only took 20 minutes longer than my old shopping trips used to take AND I am not having to go back to the store ALL MONTH LONG. We shop on Friday nights, if you go later in the evening you can get discounted meats and breads (discounted meat is OK to buy just smell it first, it shouldn’t go bad if you put it back in the freezer–take advantage of the discount!). Friday evenings are also typically a quieter time to go gallivanting about the grocery aisles.</p>

<p>Once you’ve purchased all your items, bring them on home, pat yourself on the back and take a break. I like shopping on a Friday cause I can get beans soaking overnight for chili or to go in our rice and bean lunches and then get to work on the other meals in the morning after a nice long evening of sleep. When you prepare your freezer meals, take extra time at the beginning to <em>get organized</em>. This one day of cooking goes by very quickly if you can recognize ahead of time how many onions you will need to chop up, how much ground beef you need to brown, which casseroles can go in the oven together, what you can place in a crockpot and so on.</p>

<p>Once your meals have cooled, break them into individual or family-sized portions to freeze. If a recipe makes 4 servings and you are cooking for two people, split the meal into two baggies or containers so you only have to thaw what you are going to eat that evening. We have also discovered strategies for making the most of a very small freezer for those of you without a separate one, like us. If you do have a separate freezer, I even more highly recommend reading the book mentioned above. The family has so many more tips for those of you who can buy multiple gallons of milk, cheese, and so on.</p>

<p>Alright, if you are still with me, thanks for hanging in there, we are getting close! If you didn’t write your menu on a white board or some other handy visual prior to shopping, now’s the time to do so. Once again, I now find this easier to do <em>after</em> I have all the food prepared and laid out in front of me. You’ll quickly find that many of the recipes make more portions than you will need in one month. This is when meal planning gets really fun! Now you get to start having more variety in the following months. Example: Last month I made a giant batch of chili and a giant batch of carrot soup so this month I still have 5 packages of each leftover. I can now add those meals into the mix for this month’s menu, make the same amount of new meals to mix in and then, voila! More variety and you guessed it, even more left over the next month. I also like having the extra meals because it makes giving away a meal so simple.</p>

<p>You may be wondering what about breakfast and lunch? Well, here’s where we may vary a bit on pricing. I rarely eat more than a piece of toast and a banana for breakfast and Jack has 1 egg and a slice of toast so we are very boring there. For lunches we typically rotate PB&amp;J, tuna, or a little rice and beans mix (will share recipe later) with a side salad. All very inexpensive lunch items to incorporate into your routine and none of which require making and freezing ahead of time. So, our lunches add extra bread, PB, jelly, tuna, a large bag of rice, and bagged beans to the shopping list. These are almost always on our list and are usually pretty inexpensive even without a sale.</p>

<p>As I mentioned before, our sides typically consist of rice, salad, veggies or roasted red potatoes. I usually just rotate these around with the freezer meals so we aren’t always eating the same main course with the same side–break up that routine. We also bake a batch of <a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/08/homemade-dinner-rolls/">homemade dinner rolls</a> to go with our soups each month. These cost next to nothing if you already carry a few basic baking supplies in your kitchen. Which raises yet another point, baking a few items from scratch–bread, rolls, pizza dough–goes a long way to keeping you on budget while giving you variety.</p>

<p>Are you overwhelmed yet? I know it’s a lot of information to take in but I promise 2 months in you’ll be singing it’s praises just like I was. I will leave you to soak in this information but will be posting our first month’s grocery plan with recipes and more details in the next few days. I will also be posting tips on storing all this food in a tiny freezer, showing you menu options and my grocery price tracking system. I hope you’ve enjoyed this little peak into the way we’ve learned to cut our grocery bill in half!</p>

    <p>I recently finished this simple, sweet baby blanket for my friend <a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/10/2494/">Rachel</a> as she and her husband prepare for the arrival of their second child, a tiny baby girl (name unknown). Rachel’s first child, Obadiah, is so incredibly adorable and sweet and has the cutest cheeks ever so I can’t imagine how precious her little girl will be as well.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/09/knitted-stripe-baby-blanket/knittedbabyblanket-3/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/09/knittedbabyblanket-3-575x382.jpg" alt="knitted baby blanket" title="knitted baby blanket" /></a></p>

<p>This knitted blanket is incredibly easy to make and has become my go-to pattern (if you can even call it a pattern) for all baby blanket gifts.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/09/knitted-stripe-baby-blanket/knittedbabyblanket-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/09/knittedbabyblanket-2-575x384.jpg" alt="knitted baby blanket" title="knitted baby blanket" /></a></p>

<p>To make this blanket, simply cast on 100 stitches of color A and knit the entire ball of yarn. Switch to color B, knit 1/4-1/2 the ball of yarn. Switch to color C and knit the entire ball of yarn.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/09/knitted-stripe-baby-blanket/knittedbabyblanket-1/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/09/knittedbabyblanket-1-575x382.jpg" alt="knitted baby blanket" title="knitted baby blanket" /></a></p>

<p>That’s it, simply knit on knit through 2-1/2 balls of yarn. Easy as pie!</p>

    <p>The past two weeks have absolutely flown by. As you know, I am back in classes for what should be my last year. It has taken me seven years to get to this point so you can imagine my excitement as well as my exhaustion. While most of my fellow nursing peers are just now beginning to experience their “senior-itis,” my senior-itis has been ongoing for the past three years. All that to say, despite the chaos of the last two weeks–school, new job, studying–I have made an effort to set aside little portions of each day to simply sit back and enjoy a moment of quiet solitude. Whether it’s 5 minutes or 15, I feel like these little moments go a long way to helping the rest of my day seem more manageable.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/09/silence-rejuvenation/peachbridalbouquet/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/09/peachbridalbouquet-575x431.jpg" alt="peachbridalbouquet" title="peachbridalbouquet" /></a></p>

<p>And since the farm is my typical way of relaxing–being out in nature, away from distractions and the daily grind–I decided to share this picture from a wedding Linda arranged yesterday. I think this peach bridal bouquet is stunning, simple, and ever so elegant.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/09/silence-rejuvenation/bug/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/09/bug-575x382.jpg" alt="leaf bug" title="bug" /></a></p>

<p>In the spirit of all things calm, simple and relaxing, I’ve also decided to share this picture of the lovely bug we found in our house a few weeks ago. Jack loved him and wanted some pictures so here is Freddie the leaf bug. I don’t know the technical name for these little guys, online everyone just calls them “leaf bugs” so if you know what else they are called, please fill us in.</p>

<p>Alrighty friends, I think that about does it for today. Coming soon I have 3 minutes brownies, soup recipes, a DIY wedding and our monthly shopping plan to save 50% on groceries (which worked!). Although I am unable to keep up three posts/week with classes back in session and more work hours, please keep checking back with us each week for new posts.</p>

    <p>To continue my attempt at stocking our freezer (<a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/09/lower-your-grocery-bill-monthly-meals-part-2/">Lower Grocery Bills &amp; Freezer Meals</a>), I decided to bake homemade rolls to accompany our soups. I usually direct all bread-making ventures to Jack because, unlike me, he is patient. When I bake I want to prepare the food, put it in the oven, wash the dishes, and pull the food out of the oven. Simple, easy, no hassle, and no waiting between steps. All that to say, these are the characteristics I look for in a bread recipe–I know, it’s sad, but this time it worked!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/08/homemade-dinner-rolls/homemaderolls-1/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/08/homemaderolls-1-575x411.jpg" alt="homemade rolls" title="homemade rolls (1)" /></a></p>

<p>This recipe is incredibly easy and really doesn’t take long. I followed it to a tee, but changed the seasonings on top.</p>

<p>“My Favorite Buttermilk Dinner Rolls” from The Bread Bible (slightly altered):</p>

<p><em>Ingredients:</em></p>

<p>1 tbsp dry yeast<br />
Pinch of Sugar<br />
1/4 c. warm water<br />
1 c. warm buttermilk<br />
2 tbsp. honey<br />
4 tbsp. butter<br />
1 large egg<br />
2 tsp. salt<br />
4 c. all-purpose flour (plus some for dusting during kneading)</p>

<p><em>Directions:</em></p>

<p>1.) In a small bowl combine yeast, sugar and water. Dissolve and let stand until foamy, roughly 10 minutes.</p>

<p>2.) In a large bowl, combine buttermilk, sugar, butter (melted), egg, and salt. Mix in 1-1/2 c. flour and yeast mixture. Beat on high for 2 minutes.</p>

<p>3.) Continue to add the remainder of the flour 1/2 c. at a time with a wooden spoon.</p>

<p>4.) Turn dough onto lightly floured surface and knead until smooth, 4-7 minutes by hand. Use flour to prevent sticking, 1 tbsp at a time.</p>

<p>5.) Grease a large bowl and place smooth dough inside. Turn dough over so top is greased. Cover the bowl with saran wrap and let rise until doubled in size, 1-1/2 hours.</p>

<p>6.) Deflate dough and turn out onto floured surface. Divide dough in half and roll each into a 2 to 3 inch cylinder. Cut each into 8 equal portions. Roll each into a small oval.</p>

<p>7.) Lay dough balls on a greased baking sheet about 3 inches apart. Cover with saran wrap and let sit for 30 minutes.</p>

<p>8.) Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Brush each roll with egg glaze (1 egg, 1 tbsp water, 1 tbsp milk). Sprinkle the top of the rolls with garlic, thyme, sesame seeds and pepper (or choose your own combination).</p>

<p>9.) Cut small diagonal slashes on top of each roll. Place in the oven for 15 minutes or until golden brown. If using 2 baking sheets, switch top to bottom halfway through baking process.</p>

<p>10.) Allow to cool before serving and enjoy!</p>

<p>These rolls freeze beautifully. Just make sure you seal them up nice and tight and try to get all the air out of the bag or container you store them in to reduce the chance of moisture getting trapped inside.</p>

    <p>Today was my last farm day for the year. I’m always sad when summer comes to an end but with Fall just around the corner the workload at the farm dwindles down and really, it’s just in time for me to head back to classes. After seven years and three degree changes I am finally beginning my last year. Hooray! Next week I will head back to class and will also be starting a new job. Such a busy month. I am so excited to get started with the year and finish up this chapter of my life but right now, feeling sad to say goodbye to summer and all the beauty to be found out on the farm.</p>

<p>Today Linda and I worked on a rather unique wedding. The bride wanted purple and orange–not a request we are used to getting, however, the bouquets were both fun and beautiful. The groom’s boutonniere was purple and the groomsmen had orange. Like many of us, the happy couple also enjoy a good tasting beer and thought it would be fun to include hops in their bouts. Once again, so fun!</p>

<p>I hope you’ve enjoyed these pictures and found a little bit of inspiration. I never would have thought to use purple and orange for wedding colors but after putting these together, I’m a believer! I so loved arranging this fun wedding and wish the happy couple all the best.</p>

    <p>In preparation for the coming school year our kitchen has once more turned to <a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/09/lower-your-grocery-bill-monthly-meals-part-2/">freezer-meal central</a>. I recently read a book on cutting your grocery bill in half and while I began the read thinking it would be quite useless, I can proudly say, it works! I’m very excited to share some tips with you throughout the coming months. For now, let me just emphasize the importance of going to the grocery store once monthly and taking one day each month to cook up a couple staple meals that will keep in the freezer. Last year we realized just how valuable freezer meals can be with a schedule like ours.</p>

<p><del datetime="2012-09-08T21:35:28+00:00">Anyways, I’ll get to more freezer meal recipes, tricks and tips in a few weeks</del><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/09/lower-your-grocery-bill-monthly-meals-part-2/">More freezer meals here</a>, but <del datetime="2012-09-08T21:35:28+00:00">I’ll get to</del> back to the point… While freezer meals are wonderful on the wallet, we love our fresh fruits and veggies so we supplement our menu with produce dinners from the farmer’s market. Whipping up a quick vegetarian meal once or twice a week goes a long way to incorporating variety into your month of meals.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/08/grilled-eggplant-tomato-aioli-sandwiches/egg-tomato-eggplant-sandwich-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/08/Egg-tomato-eggplant-sandwich-2-575x410.jpg" alt="Egg, tomato, eggplant sandwich " title="Egg, tomato, eggplant sandwich (2)" /></a></p>

<p>This week one of our produce meals consisted of eggplant, tomatoes, onions and eggs. The tomatoes were from our very own garden, the eggplant was thrown into my produce bag for free after buying 5 zucchinis and 5 yellow squash and the eggs are from a local farmer. Neat-O, right? I love fresh!</p>

<p>Here’s how we put this dish together:</p>

<p>1.) Grill Eggplant: Slice eggplant, sprinkle with salt, parsley, pepper, thyme and garlic, place in a sauce pan with 2 tbsp. of olive oil, cook each side 3 minutes or until slightly browned</p>

<p>2.) Saute onions in 1 tbsp of olive oil</p>

<p>3.) Cook 2 over-easy eggs</p>

<p>4.) Prepare Aioli Sauce: 1/4 c. light mayo or Greek Yogurt, 1 tbsp. olive oil, 1 tbsp. lemon juice, 1 minced garlic clove</p>

<p>5.) Slice tomatoes, toast bread and assemble sandwiches</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/08/grilled-eggplant-tomato-aioli-sandwiches/egg-tomato-eggplant-sandwich-1/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/08/Egg-tomato-eggplant-sandwich-1-575x383.jpg" alt="Egg, tomato, eggplant sandwich " title="Egg, tomato, eggplant sandwich (1)" /></a></p>

<p>Easy as pie! My favorite part was slicing open the yolk and letting it drizzle all over the sandwich, seriously, it was SO good.</p>

<p>Next time you are looking for a healthy, tasty and filling dinner recipe, give these open-faced sandwiches a try. Trust me, it’s a decision you won’t regret.</p>

    <p>I think the best thing about Summer and Saturdays is the Farmer’s Market. I don’t know if there is a better excuse for waking up early on the weekend. This weekend, Kristin and I manned the Aunt Willie’s Wildflower station at the Kingsport market and had such a great morning.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/08/mens-shirt-refashion-farmers-market/farmers-market/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/08/Farmers-Market-575x417.jpg" alt="" title="Farmer's Market" /></a></p>

<p>I think she was a bit more awake than I was at this point. We’ve also started taking instagram photos of our last year together so here’s a look at that one too.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/08/mens-shirt-refashion-farmers-market/farmersmarket/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/08/farmersmarket-575x575.jpg" alt="" title="farmersmarket" /></a></p>

<p>The shirt I am wearing in these pictures takes me to my next topic of discussion–clothing refashions.</p>

<p>Some of our friends were thinning out their closets last week. I peeked into one of the bags destined for the college “share closet” and stole this men’s dress shirt. Of course, when I tried the shirt on it was incredibly long with sleeves that extended about 8 inches past my hands plus oodles of growing room under the arms and around my middle (sorry, no before pics that are worth showing you). Here is a quick and dirty tutorial to give you an idea of how easy it is to take in a shirt.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/08/mens-shirt-refashion-farmers-market/mensdresshirtrefashion/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/08/Mensdresshirtrefashion-325x486.jpg" alt="" title="Men'sdresshirtrefashion" /></a></p>

<p>To start, I buttoned the shirt and turned it inside out. Next, I lined up the front and back pieces, set my sewing machine needle in 2 inches from the original sew lines (or however much you need it to go in) and followed the shape of the original line down the shirt sides. Where the original line curves for shape (which is very little for men), I exaggerated the curve so it would hug in the right places (think man shape vs. woman).</p>

<p>For the sleeves, I followed the same guidelines as above, moving my needle in from the original sew line and continuing to sew up the arm, around the armpit and connecting it to the line I sewed down the shirt sides.</p>

<p>Next, I cut the sleeves at the elbow, folded a cuff and sewed it in place.</p>

<p>Not the fanciest sew job but to the untrained eye, it looks pretty darn good (and it only took 15 minutes). Now I have a fun dress shirt to go with my skinny jeans. So, next time you are thinking about throwing out the husbands old shirts, think again and see what fun fashions you can come up with.</p>

    <p>Sorry for the brief hiatus from posting, I hope you all have had a chance to check out last week’s <a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/08/jungle-safari-baby-shower/">Jungle Safari Baby Shower</a>. The hubby and I decided to take a last-minute trip up to Baltimore this weekend to visit our good friends Adam and Leslie. We kind of love them. With classes starting back in one week, we figured it was one of those “now-or-never” moments.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/08/baltimore-friends/baltimore-3/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/08/Baltimore-3-575x383.jpg" alt="Baltimore" title="Baltimore (3)" /></a></p>

<p>We had such a blast in Baltimore. Breakfast at Gertrudes outside the BMA, seriously the most amazing basil hollandaise sauce over eggplant and poached eggs. It was <em>so</em> delicious that I decided my latest mission is to cook the perfect poached egg.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/08/baltimore-friends/baltimore-4/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/08/Baltimore-4-575x412.jpg" alt="" title="Baltimore (4)" /></a></p>

<p>Anyways, back to our weekend. We took in the beautiful views on Federal Hill overlooking the harbor.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/08/baltimore-friends/baltimore-5/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/08/Baltimore-5-575x382.jpg" alt="" title="Baltimore (5)" /></a></p>

<p>Took a walk around Fort McHenry (think Star Spangled Banner). Loved the ocean views surrounding the fort.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/08/baltimore-friends/baltimore-1/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/08/Baltimore-1-575x382.jpg" alt="" title="Baltimore (1)" /></a></p>

<p>We even managed a mini beach trip on Sunday followed by dinner in Little Italy and the most amazing cannolis. Yes, it was a great weekend.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/08/baltimore-friends/baltimore-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/08/Baltimore-2-575x384.jpg" alt="" title="Baltimore (2)" /></a></p>

<p>Tomorrow is another day of flower cutting and market arranging at the farm. Kristin and I will be running the flower business at the Kingsport Farmer’s Market on Saturday so anyone in the area should come out and visit us. I promise, once you see the flowers you won’t regret giving up your Saturday morning. I’ll be sure to take some fun market pictures for you all. Happy Weekend!</p>

    <p>Last weekend’s jungle party was a success! I took way too many pictures so these collages are my attempt to show you all the details. To be completely honest, the jungle theme was pretty easy to pull off–think grasses, lots of them. That’s right, I used vases and vases of grasses and hosta leaves to bring the jungle indoors.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/08/jungle-safari-baby-shower/junglebabyshowerdecorations/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/08/junglebabyshowerdecorations-575x411.jpg" alt="jungle baby shower decorations" title="junglebabyshowerdecorations" /></a></p>

<p>For the table, I bought three yards of animal-print fabric and used a strip of burlap to break up the pattern down the middle of the table. I used green glass dishes to continue our nature theme and bring color to the table. I also cut grasses with branching brown ends on top to add a bit of nature and height to the table.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/08/jungle-safari-baby-shower/junglebabyshower-decorations-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/08/junglebabyshower-decorations-2-575x359.jpg" alt="jungle baby shower decorations" title="junglebabyshower decorations (2)" /></a></p>

<p>The next step to creating this jungle safari table was to make brown tissue paper poms. There are many tutorials for making these poms and I promise they are all very simple. For tutorials however, I usually revert to my good friend, <a href="http://www.marthastewart.com/how-to/tissue-paper-pom-poms-how-to">Martha Stewart</a> (cause she’s awesome).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/08/jungle-safari-baby-shower/junglebabyshower-decorations-3/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/08/junglebabyshower-decorations-3-575x359.jpg" alt="jungle baby  shower decorations tissue poms" title="junglebabyshower decorations (3)" /></a></p>

<p>To help give the table dimension and to label the food, I made little sachets with fabric squares, wooden skewers and circle tags (tutorial coming soon). I have never liked my handwriting so I used a fancy stencil to write out the food labels.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/08/jungle-safari-baby-shower/shower-gifts-and-decor/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/08/shower-gifts-and-decor-575x359.jpg" alt="jungle shower decor" title="jungle shower decor" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/08/jungle-safari-baby-shower/junglebabyshower-decorations-4/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/08/junglebabyshower-decorations-4-575x359.jpg" alt="jungle baby  shower decorations food labels" title="junglebabyshower decorations (4)" /></a></p>

<p>I also set up a little card station at the party. We pre-purchased a set of thank-you cards and a book of stamps for the parents-to-be. Then I set up the card station for guests to write their name and address on envelopes so the parents-to-be wouldn’t have to find everyone’s addresses on their own. The station had a giraffe-print fabric square, grasses, a basket for the written-on envelopes, and of course the thank-you cards and pens.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/08/jungle-safari-baby-shower/junglebabyshower-decorations-6/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/08/junglebabyshower-decorations-6-575x359.jpg" alt="jungle baby  shower decorations card station" title="jungle baby  shower decorations card station" /></a></p>

<p>I drew 2ft. jungle animals on black card stock and taped them in various areas around the house. I am hoping to make you all some printable stencils for my jungle animals so keep checking back. I also printed out cautionary signs: “Elephant XING”/”Do Not Feed the Animals”/”Trespassers Will Be Eaten”</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/08/jungle-safari-baby-shower/junglebabyshower-decorations-7/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/08/junglebabyshower-decorations-7-575x359.jpg" alt="jungle baby  shower decorations jungle animals" title="jungle baby  shower decorations jungle animals" /></a></p>

<p>In the gift area I switched from brown animal print fabric squares to black and white. If you can find animal print fabric for cheap just buy it in yards and cut it into squares. I could not find any inexpensive animal print fabrics so I opted for the $.99 fabric squares from Walmart (they have bunches of prints available). Notice in the picture my hanging <a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/06/jungle-paper-mobile/">paper jungle mobiles</a>, none of the pictures of those were that great but I had them hung around the gift opening area and in the sunroom.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/08/jungle-safari-baby-shower/junglebabyshower-decorations-10/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/08/junglebabyshower-decorations-10-575x359.jpg" alt="jungle baby  shower decorations zebra print" title="jungle baby  shower decorations zebra print" /></a></p>

<p>Another station was set up for the guests to leave an encouraging message for the parents to be. I used leaf and flower-print card stock, a hole punch, and twine to make little hanging notes. I also brought some of my potted plants from home for the table greenery. Behind this station, I lined small clear bottles filled with grasses to create a grass wall separating the front room from the kitchen.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/08/jungle-safari-baby-shower/junglebabyshower-decorations-8/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/08/junglebabyshower-decorations-8-575x359.jpg" alt="jungle baby shower decorations notes" title="jungle baby shower decorations notes" /></a></p>

<p>My last jungle station held the party favors. My hubby makes himself loads and loads of yummy granola for snacks so I convinced him to make me a very large batch for the party. Then I scooped out one cup of granola for each ziplock bag, wrapped the bag in burlap squares and tied them off with twine.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/08/jungle-safari-baby-shower/junglebabyshower-decorations-9/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/08/junglebabyshower-decorations-9-575x359.jpg" alt="jungle baby shower decorations party favor granola treats" title="jungle baby shower decorations party favor granola treats" /></a></p>

<p>This was such a fun party to plan and I think a fun time was had by all the guests and most importantly the parents-to-be. I hope these pictures serve as inspiration for your next party. I’ll try to post a few tutorials for the miscellaneous jungle decorations very soon.</p>

    <p>This past weekend we held a jungle baby shower out on the farm (pictures coming soon). For my gift, I decided to go with necessities as opposed to adorable baby clothes–always a tough decision.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/08/gift-wrap-baby-shower-basket/babyshowergiftbasket-3/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/07/babyshowergiftbasket-3-575x411.jpg" alt="babyshowergiftbasket" title="babyshowergiftbasket (3)" /></a></p>

<p>I thought I would play on the “shower” aspect and compile shower supplies for the mommy and daddy to test out.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/08/gift-wrap-baby-shower-basket/babyshowergiftbasket-1/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/07/babyshowergiftbasket-1-325x452.jpg" alt="babyshowergiftbasket " title="babyshowergiftbasket (1)" /></a></p>

<p><em>Included items:</em> washcloths, shampoo, body wash, baby powder, drying mats &amp; burp cloth, washable wipes to go and, of course, little shower animals just because they were so cute.</p>

<p>My hope was to have a little paper umbrella sticking out of the box. Sadly, the umbrella didn’t quite survive all the way to the farm, but a fun idea for those of you better at paper-umbrella making than I am.</p>

    <p>I feel like I say this every week but yesterday’s farm flowers were <em>gorgeous</em>! Seriously. Kristin took eight buckets of flowers to a wedding in Virginia. You would think with eight buckets gone we wouldn’t have many left to work with but that was not the case. Instead, we (Linda and I) made a record amount of market bouquets–a grand total of 50 (trust me, that’s a lot).</p>

<p>Linda asked if I wanted to make an arrangement for the altar on Sunday and I, of course, jumped on board immediately. It was really hard to not make something beautiful with the array of flowers we had to work with.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/07/pink-burgundy-altar-arrangement/pinkburgundyaltararrangement-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/07/pinkburgundyaltararrangement-2.jpg" alt="pink &amp; burgundy altar arrangement" title="pink&amp;burgundyaltararrangement (2)" /></a></p>

<p>This pink and burgundy arrangement is my finished product and I must say, I love it! Pitcher arrangements like these are perfect for a country wedding or for simply taking to church on Sunday to share with others.</p>

<p>Here’s how this pitcher arrangement came to be:</p>

<p>First I started with the large limelight hydrangea. I cut them down to size and angled one toward each side of the pitcher and one smaller one a bit higher in the back to provide a “back” to the bouquet (a place where the eye will stop looking).</p>

<p>Next, I added several bunches of dark pink lisianthus buds. These pop against the creamy-white hydrangeas and serve as a great filler since the mouth of my pitcher is so wide.</p>

<p>Then I added two stems of lilies, one low and one higher, each angled a separate direction.I also added a pink and white gladiola semi-centered. The lisianthus serve as support for keeping the lilies and gladiola securely in place.</p>

<p>Finally I filled in the gaps. Down low I added trailing amaranthus (that’s the pretty burgundy spilling over the edge), I also added bits of white and green filler (poke weed, grasses), a couple green/cream lisianthus and hot pink dianthus.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/07/pink-burgundy-altar-arrangement/pinkburgundyaltararrangement-1/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/07/pinkburgundyaltararrangement-1.jpg" alt="pink &amp; burgundy altar arrangement" title="pink&amp;burgundyaltararrangement (1)" /></a></p>

<p>Arrangements like these are fairly simple to create if you stick to a specific order when combining your flowers–heavy bulky stems first, delicate flowers next supported by the larger flowers, then smaller pops of color, collar greenery and delicate accents.</p>

<p>I hope you’ve enjoyed this mini-flower-arrangement lesson. Try your own pitcher arrangement at home, all it takes is a few stems from your own backyard.</p>

    <p>Wedding bouquets are by far my favorite flower piece to arrange. There are multiple factors to consider when planning a bridal bouquet. Many brides put all their creativity and thought into the flower type and completely forget to adorn the bouquet handle. Adding a bit of glam to the bouquet handle is simple and can make a huge impact. One of my favorite handle wrap techniques is the <em>classic braid</em> adorned with pearl corsage pins. This is the braid technique I used on last week’s <a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/07/silver-gold-brooch-bouquet/">bridal brooch bouquet</a>? This simple classic braid is simple, elegant and fail-safe.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/06/ribbon-braided-bouquet/bridalbroochbraid-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/06/bridalbroochbraid-2-575x382.jpg" alt="bridal brooch bouquet" title="bridalbroochbraid (2)" /></a></p>

<p><em>Preparation:</em></p>

<p>Arrange your flowers and tie with a rubber band close to the neck. Cover the rubber band with green floral tape, then proceed down the stems as far as you want your braid to run. Leave at least 1 inch of the stems exposed at the bottom. If you want to cover the entire bottom of the stems as well, you need to wait until the day of or find some really great ribbon that won’t fall out of place after being soaked in water all night.</p>

<p>Choose your ribbon, a medium width is best. Place your bouquet on it’s side with the “front” facing you (the side that will not face the bride). If you are braiding up the majority of the stems, use 1 entire roll of ribbon. You may end up cutting some off at the end but it is better than running short and this technique uses much more ribbon than you might think.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/06/ribbon-braided-bouquet/brooch-bouquet-and-braid/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/06/brooch-bouquet-and-braid-575x359.jpg" alt="brooch bouquet and braid" title="brooch bouquet and braid" /></a></p>

<p><em>The Braid:</em></p>

<p>Step #1: Starting at the <em>bottom</em> of your stems, wrap the ribbon around the back of the stem bundle and even up the two sides of ribbon. Hold the ribbons up toward you and taut.</p>

<p>Step #2: Cross the ribbons, one in front of the other two times. You are basically switching the ribbon from your left hand to your right and back again. You should have a twisted tangle of ribbon now. Now pull the ribbons to their separate sides, this should move something resembling a knot down toward the stems.</p>

<p>Step #3: Cross your ribbons around the back of the stems to switch their sides. Repeat the crossing in front by once again crossing the two strands around each other twice then pulling the strands away from each other to move the knot down.</p>

<p>Step #4: As you tighten each “knot,” try to keep them in line with one another and make sure you are overlapping the ribbon all the way up the stems so there are no gaps.</p>

<p>Step #5: Continue to braid your ribbon to the neck of the flowers and finish the braid by either tying a knot or a bow. If you have extra ribbon, measure the strands to the end of your bouquet stems and cut each at an angle.</p>

<p>Step #6: Using short corsage pins, place one at the base of each knot to dress up your braid. Push the pins in and up so they don’t poke out the other side of the stem bundle and stab the bride.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/07/ribbon-braid-bouquet-diy/dsc_0050-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/07/DSC_0050-325x541.jpg" alt="bridesmaid ribbon mini braid" title="bridesmaid ribbon mini braid" /></a>While the bride may enjoy having a full braid that covers the entire length of the stems, bridesmaids often opt for the mini-braid which covers only a portion of the bouquet handle. This technique (seen in the picture at right) follows the same steps but it is only necessary to wrap a small portion of the stem with floral tape–just enough to cover the rubber band.</p>

<p>I hope these pictures are helpful. Ribbon braiding really is a very simple and quick process. As always, please let me know if you have any questions.</p>

    <p>Remember those beautiful brooches I mentioned in my <a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/07/bridal-brooch-bouquet-sneak-peek/">sneak peak bridal bouquet</a> post last week? Well, I have finally managed to pull all of that gorgeous jewelry together into one stunning bridal brooch bouquet.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/07/silver-gold-brooch-bouquet/bridalbroochbouquetantique/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/07/bridalbroochbouquetantique-575x382.jpg" alt="bridal brooch bouquet" title="bridalbroochbouquetantique" /></a></p>

<p>This being my first attempt at a brooch bouquet, I am quite pleased with the finished product. I cannot take all of the credit however, the lovely bride did an absolutely fantastic job of picking out all of the brooches for her bouquet. At first, I wasn’t sure how it was all going to come together as she had a wide array of metals and gemstones included in the mix, but her creative instincts paid off and the jewelry came together beautifully.</p>

<p>The hardest part of this bouquet (which I didn’t have to do) would definitely be the wiring of the brooches. In order to make one of these bouquets you need to take floral wire or some other sturdy wire and loop it around the clasps on each individual brooch. The tricky part is wiring the brooches well enough that they will remain upright and sturdy. The more time you take to wire the brooches carefully, the easier it will be to assemble your bouquet. You may also want to use hot glue underneath the brooch where you attach the wire to help secure the wire more sturdily to the clasp.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/07/silver-gold-brooch-bouquet/bridalbroochbouquet-1-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/07/bridalbroochbouquet-1-575x382.jpg" alt="" title="bridalbroochbouquet (1)" /></a></p>

<p>Take three strong hydrangeas. We used fake ones which I highly recommend if you are making a full bouquet like the one pictured. This bouquet is very heavy so you will need the heavy weight of fake flowers to support all of the brooches. If you prefer a bouquet with intermittent brooches, you can use live hydrangea and add other live flowers into the mix to help fill holes and support the jewelry.</p>

<p>Cut your fake hydrangea stems the length that you want your bouquet to be. I use a large mason jar as my guide, placing the flowers inside you want the bottom edge of the flowers to rest gently on the top edge of the jar (or whatever vase you will use at the reception).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/07/bridal-brooch-bouquet-sneak-peek/broochbouquetcg-1/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/07/broochbouquetcg-1-575x472.jpg" alt="brooch bouquet" title="broochbouquet" /></a></p>

<p>Wrap your hydrangea stems together with floral tape (no need to wrap all the way down, just secure them together).</p>

<p>Now comes the fun part. Poke each of your wired brooches through the tops of the hydrangea petals until they rest gently on top of your flowers. Continue to add brooches one by one until you have covered the tops and sides of your hydrangeas.</p>

<p>Once all the brooches are in place, carefully wrap all wire stems together using floral tape. At this point, the bouquet is very heavy so you may want to ask a friend to hold it as you wrap.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/07/silver-gold-brooch-bouquet/bridalbroochbraid/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/07/bridalbroochbraid-575x382.jpg" alt="bridalbroochbraid" title="bridalbroochbraid" /></a></p>

<p>Once the stems are wrapped all the way to the bottom. Grab your ribbon and cover the floral tape with whichever ribbon wrap style you prefer. I will post a tutorial for the classic braid shown in these pictures next Friday.</p>

<p>I hope you’ve found these instructions helpful. As always let me know if you have any questions or if I need to clarify any steps.</p>

    <p>“And while it takes courage to achieve greatness, it takes more courage to find fulfillment in being ordinary. For the joys that last have little relationship to achievement, to standing one step higher on the victory platform. What is the adventure in being ordinary? It is daring to love just for the pleasure of giving it away. It is venturing to give new life and to nurture it to maturity. It is working hard for the pure joy of being tired at the end of the day.

    <p>For today’s floral post I thought I would share a sneak peak into my latest wedding project. One of our bride’s asked if we could arrange her bouquet, no surprise there. The catch? Not a flower bouquet.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/07/bridal-brooch-bouquet-sneak-peek/broochbouquet-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/07/broochbouquet-2-575x382.jpg" alt="brooch bouquet" title="broochbouquet (2)" /></a></p>

<p>Have you seen these beautiful heirloom brooch bouquets? There are many varieties of brooch bouquets and personally, I think they are absolutely exquisite.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/07/bridal-brooch-bouquet-sneak-peek/broochbouquet-1/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/07/broochbouquet-1-575x382.jpg" alt="brooch bouquet" title="broochbouquet (1)" /></a></p>

<p>I really can’t express how excited I am to put this bouquet together. I’ll be posting the finished pictures on the blog very very soon so stay tuned.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/07/bridal-brooch-bouquet-sneak-peek/broochbouquet-3/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/07/broochbouquet-3-575x382.jpg" alt="brooch bouquet" title="broochbouquet (3)" /></a></p>

<p>These are just a few of the wonderful brooches I get to work with. Don’t you wish this was your job?</p>

    <p>Today’s simple gift wrap technique was inspired by the hoards of leftover yarn currently taking over my craft room. To make your own pink yarn &amp; raffia gift wrap you will need yarn, double sided tape and a piece of pink raffia (makes sense).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/07/pink-yarn-raffia-gift-wrap/pinkyarngiftwrap-1/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/07/pinkyarngiftwrap-1-575x412.jpg" alt="pink yarn gift wrap" title="pinkyarngiftwrap (1)" /></a></p>

<p>Simply adhere tape to the top of your gift box/lid. Cut strips of yarn to fit across the top, align side by side until the top is covered. Place lid on box and secure with raffia bow.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/07/pink-yarn-raffia-gift-wrap/pinkyarnraffiagiftwrap/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/07/pinkyarnraffiagiftwrap-325x454.jpg" alt="pink yarn gift wrap" title="pinkyarnraffiagiftwrap" /></a></p>

<p>It’s that simple. This pink yarn &amp; raffia box took about 10 minutes to throw together. Don’t dismiss that leftover yarn the next time you are looking for a easy way to dress up your gift wrap.</p>

I have struggled to come up with an idea that could turn the hundreds of extremely creative ideas into one project that I can truly call my own–my idea, my style, my brain child. Although I am one of the biggest supporters of Pinterest, I find it becomes more &amp; more difficult to be original after seeing the incredible ideas submitted by users. Really, I just want to make exact replicas of most of the projects I see, but no, I push on and try to make each project my own. I think I did just that with this plywood art.</p>

<p>I received this beautiful Monet print from my friend Kristin after her recent excursion to D.C. with her junior high students (isn’t she sweet). I struggled with the many ways to really make the print stand out on the vast expanse of white wall currently found in our apartment. Originally I started this project thinking I would just paint a cute saying of some sort on the boards but luckily the print came to mind and the finished result makes me happy.</p>

<p><strong>Wood Panel Art</strong></p>

<p><em>Materials:</em></p>

<p>2-8ft 1x4in boards<br />
1-4ft 1×1-1/2in board<br />
1 bag of 2in screws<br />
1 small jar of wood stain<br />
3 colors of paint (mine were gray and blue and yellow)<br />
1 canvas frame<br />
1 print<br />
60-grit sandpaper</p>

<p><em>Instructions:</em></p>

<p>Cut the two 1x4in boards into three-2 1/2ft long pieces and sand.</p>

<p>After sanding, stain two of the boards with wood stain. Set aside.</p>

<p>Next, get your other two paint colors ready. Dip your brush into the paint and then swirl around in a cup of water so the paint is extremely watery. You want to use your paint sort of like a watercolor and let the watery tint soak into the board. So, to reiterate, you aren’t really “painting” the board but more “tinting” the board. Got it?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/07/wood-panel-wall-art/woodpanelwallart-3/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/07/woodpanelwallart-3-575x384.jpg" alt="painted wood panels" title="woodpanelwallart (3)" /></a></p>

<p>Allow the boards to dry. Meanwhile, take your 1×1-1/2in board and cut two pieces long enough to fit horizontally across the back of your boards (20in each). This is what you will screw your 2-1/2ft pieces into.</p>

<p>Take your canvas frame and paint it using your third color (mine was bright yellow to accent the yellow sunflowers). Let dry.</p>

<p>Come back to your stained and painted boards and begin to sand the edges and tops until you achieve the desired amount of weathering.</p>

<p>Now it is time to assemble. Turn your boards over so the front is facedown. Stagger the boards and place the 1×1-1/2in boards across the back horizontally, one toward the top and one toward the bottom (see picture). Screw the boards to the blocks.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/07/wood-panel-wall-art/woodpanelwallart-1/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/07/woodpanelwallart-1-575x382.jpg" alt="wood panel wall art" title="woodpanelwallart (1)" /></a></p>

<p>Once all the boards are secure, turn the pallet over and glue your print to the center with craft glue.</p>

<p>Last of all, take the painted frame and using wood glue, attach the frame around your print.</p>

<p>This project took about 6 hours for me to make. The longest part is sanding and drying time, but overall it is fairly simple to throw together.</p>

    <p>I am constantly writing to you about buying flowers locally and arranging them yourself for special events or weddings but what about those specialty pieces like corsages and boutonnieres? Can you also make these yourself? The answer is “yes &amp; yes” and I’m ready to show you how.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/07/how-to-boutonniere/bluegrayboutonniere-6/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/07/bluegrayboutonniere-6-575x382.jpg" alt="blue gray boutonniere how to" title="bluegrayboutonniere (6)" /></a></p>

<p>This little boutonniere is incredibly simple to make and uses items that are hardy enough to remain upright even when out of water overnight. When we make boutonnieres for weddings on the farm, they are usually assembled the afternoon prior to the wedding, at the same time we arrange centerpieces and bouquets. If you know what to use, this is not too far ahead of the event to assemble the boutonniere. Once you have finished assembling all your bouts, simply store in the refrigerator until the big event.</p>

<p>When choosing stems for your bout, be sure to choose ones that are hardy. This bout uses Ivy as the backing, dusty miller, blue thistle, dianthus and a small succulent.</p>

<p><em>Assembly:</em></p>

<p>Step 1: Find a flat surface and lay out one leaf of Ivy. Lay one leaf of Dusty Miller on top.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/07/how-to-boutonniere/bluegrayboutonniere-8/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/07/bluegrayboutonniere-8-575x411.jpg" alt="" title="bluegrayboutonniere (8)" /></a></p>

<p>Step 2: Now add a small piece of blue thistle on top of the Dusty Miller and slightly left of center.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/07/how-to-boutonniere/bluegrayboutonniere-1/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/07/bluegrayboutonniere-1-575x410.jpg" alt="blue gray boutonniere how to" title="bluegrayboutonniere (1)" /></a></p>

<p>Step 3: Lay the Dianthus to the right of the thistle.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/07/how-to-boutonniere/bluegrayboutonniere-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/07/bluegrayboutonniere-2-575x411.jpg" alt="blue gray boutonniere how to" title="bluegrayboutonniere (2)" /></a></p>

<p>Step 4: Push the succulent up under the Dianthus and slightly to the right of center. You should position the succulent so that it is sort of supporting the Dianthus, that way, even if it decides to wilt it will be supported and go unnoticed.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/07/how-to-boutonniere/bluegrayboutonniere-3/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/07/bluegrayboutonniere-3-575x411.jpg" alt="blue gray boutonniere how to" title="bluegrayboutonniere (3)" /></a></p>

<p>Step 5: Now you want to add a smaller Ivy leaf to the front of the bout, right underneath the succulent giving it a sort of clam-like appearance (sorry I forgot this picture, but look at the finished product up top and you will see what I mean).</p>

<p>Step 6: Pinch the stems together right underneath the heads of the stems and cut the stems and varying lengths. This is helpful for those of you who want to cover the stems with ribbon, it makes a gradual thickening as you up the stems toward the flowers.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/07/how-to-boutonniere/bluegrayboutonniere-4/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/07/bluegrayboutonniere-4-575x382.jpg" alt="blue gray boutonniere how to" title="bluegrayboutonniere (4)" /></a></p>

<p>Step 7: While holding the stems tightly with one hand, grab your roll of florist tape and begin to wrap the stems at the neck of the bout. If you just want a simple bout without ribbon, continue to wrap the stems all the way down with the florist tape (ribbon wrap tutorial to come).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/07/how-to-boutonniere/bluegrayboutonniere-5/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/07/bluegrayboutonniere-5-575x410.jpg" alt="blue gray boutonniere how to" title="bluegrayboutonniere (5)" /></a></p>

<p>There you have it, one <em>very</em> simple boutonniere crash course. Don’t forget to be creative with your materials–there are an endless possibilities when making your bout. One of my all-time favorite items to use is dried wheat or barley for a vintage look.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/07/how-to-boutonniere/bluegrayboutonniere-7/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/07/bluegrayboutonniere-7-575x411.jpg" alt="blue gray boutonniere how to" title="bluegrayboutonniere (7)" /></a></p>

    <p>Recently I’ve been working on a few decorations for a friend’s baby shower in July. Their nursery is going to have jungle decor so we decided to extend the theme to the shower as well.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/06/jungle-paper-mobile/paperjunglemobile/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/06/paperjunglemobile-575x365.jpg" alt="paper jungle mobile baby shower" title="paperjunglemobile" /></a></p>

<p>I found a beautiful animal print fabric for a table runner ($5/yd) and decided to contrast the muted browns with bright jungle colors.</p>

<p>Here are a few simple steps to making your own mobile:</p>

<p>1.) Cut cardstock into 1X8-inch strips. I used seven shades of brown, green, yellow and gray.</p>

<p>2.) Next, line the colors up in gradient order and decide on your mobile length. I ended up using 28 strips of paper for each mobile.</p>

<p>3.) After deciding pattern and length, stack the strips in order and head to your sewing machine. Place a piece of tape on the machine as a guide to help you sew straight down the middle of each strip of paper.</p>

<p>4.) Sew. Simply push each piece of paper under the needle, continue stitching until you have achieved the desired distance between strips and then place the next strip under the needle. Be sure to leave excess string on each end of your mobile for hanging.</p>

<p>5.) If you are using a light-weight paper, such as vellum you may want to weigh down the end of your string after hanging to avoid curling at the bottom of the mobile. <a href="http://www.projectwedding.com/wedding-ideas/diy-modern-colorful-mobiles">Project Wedding</a> makes this mobile with vellum and attaches a fishing weight at the bottom to weigh it down. The card stock however, is heavy enough that this curling does not occur (hence my choosing cardstock). The cardstock is also a cheaper purchase than vellum.</p>

<p><em>Project wedding vellum mobile:</em> $25<br />
<em>Sweet Peonies cardstock mobile:</em> $10 (even less if you already have various pieces of cardstock on hand like me)</p>

<p>I love how the mobiles turned out. I have made 5 so far and will hang them above the food table at the baby shower. I am also tying in the jungle greens by placing tall ornamental grasses on the table and surrounding areas which should complement the green mobiles nicely. I hope you’ve enjoyed this little sneak peek at the jungle baby shower. <del datetime="2012-08-11T19:36:16+00:00">I’ll be sure to post pictures of the finished event.</del> You can see finished photos of the baby shower <a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/08/jungle-safari-baby-shower/">here</a>.</p>

    <p>Jungle-themed baby showers seem to be very in vogue this year. Why not make your shower gift stand out by matching the wrap to the jungle theme?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/06/jungle-gift-wrap/junglegiftwrap-1/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/06/junglegiftwrap-1-575x382.jpg" alt="jungle gift wrap" title="junglegiftwrap (1)" /></a></p>

<p>This simple gift wrap idea uses one $.97 swatch of giraffe fabric, a small piece of twine, and 2 leaves from my front porch. Total wrapping time–3 minutes.</p>

    <p>Welcome to our new site, <em>Sweet Peonies</em>! This past year I’ve been talking with Jack about all the changes I would like to make to the blog if only I knew how. He, being the wonderful husband that he is, decided to learn all the coding necessary for making my blogging dreams come true! I think the design of our new blog is much more in line with my taste and style and it will open the door for some fun new post themes in the future.</p>

<p>Since Jack has put so much time into the little details of this blog, those that may be overlooked, I thought I would take a moment to point out and explain a few changes.</p>

<p>Of course, the first thing you’ll notice is our name change. Although <em>The Kitchen Curtains</em> served us well this past year, I think our new name <em>Sweet Peonies</em> is more my style–simple, concise, &amp; sweet. Growing up, my mom had nicknames for my sister and I. Kendra was mom’s “sunshine” and I was her “sweet pea.” I decided to combine that with my love of flowers and nature and so, here you are reading this post at <em>Sweet Peonies</em>.</p>

<p>Next, we changed the blog colors a bit. I like the bolds that were prevalent on the old site but, at heart, I’m a simple girl who likes neutrals colors, clean lines, nature, western-themes &amp; delicate details. That seemed like a tall order to design for the entrance page to the blog so we chose to focus on clean lines and simplicity which I think shows through our colors, title, and layout.</p>

<p>Jack has managed simple highlighting behind each section of text on our pages. I think my favorite technical aspect is probably the blog color wheel that you’ll see when you hover over each category on the menu bar—isn’t he clever?</p>

<p>Also, for those of you who may enjoy reading on-the-go, the blog has reactivity to screen size. Check us out on your iphone or ipod to see what I mean. Of course, there are still a few kinks popping up with this one but it is working more consistently now.</p>

<p>Another neat addition is the muted post sections. Roll your mouse over the social bars on each post (pin, google, facebook, etc.), you’ll notice the bars come to life when you roll over them. A simple addition but I think it helps make the overall design.</p>

<p>There are many other “behind the scenes” design treats coded into the site that I’ll be honest I don’t quite understand but I am ever so grateful to my husband for including. He is still working on our new gallery viewing format for the “Photos” tab but it will be a few more weeks before we can incorporate the new layouts.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoy the changes we’ve made, take your time and take a look around. Let us know what you think about the new site and please leave a message for Jack letting him know his hard work has paid off well. I’ve been told to expect some intermittent “blackouts” for the first 24 hours so if you get an error message, just try reloading.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading and I look forward to sharing new posting categories with you in the next few months.</p>

    <p>For this week’s Friday at the Farm, we had our first bridal luncheon of the summer. In fact, the only bridal luncheon on the books this year. For those of you who are unfamiliar with this event, Linda gives our brides the option of having a bridal luncheon the day before their wedding. This luncheon allows the bride and bridesmaids to relax on the farm for a couple of hours and basically play with flowers. Sounds nice, right?!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/06/sweet-pink-bouquet-herbs/pinkbridesmaidbouquet-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/06/pinkbridesmaidbouquet-2-575x382.jpg" alt="pink bridesmaid bouquet" title="pinkbridesmaidbouquet (2)" /></a></p>

<p>We teach the ladies how to arrange their bouquets for the big day and, of course, help them as needed. Some brides and bridesmaids are quick to catch on to the techniques involved in hand-held-bouquet-making, others prefer to have us shape the bulk of their arrangement–either way, the bridal luncheons are fun for all.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/06/sweet-pink-bouquet-herbs/pinkbridesmaidbouquet-4/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/06/pinkbridesmaidbouquet-4.jpg" alt="pink bridesmaid bouquet" title="pinkbridesmaidbouquet (4)" /></a></p>

<p>Linda and I also arranged market bouquets following the luncheon festivities. Here is one of my favorite arrangements from the day. I also found a fantastic new picture spot on the farm–love this lighting.</p>

<p><em>Arrangement:</em> sweet peas, decorative sage, dianthus, mountain mint (smells SO good), oregano, goose neck</p>

    <p>Recently, Jack and I have been diligent in carrying out our summer exercise routine. Our slow and clumsy pace is not helped by the ever increasing heat and humidity of East Tennessee. Lucky for us, the view is fantastic! Check out a few more pictures of our favorite piece of Tennessee earth.</p>

    <p>A new baby, sick friend, a college student getting ready for finals–there are always opportunities to prepare a meal for someone in need. Unfortunately, not everyone has time to prepare an extra meal in the middle of a busy week.</p>

<p>The next time you contribute food to a friend in need, consider assembling pre-cooked ingredients in a small basket that they can quickly throw together. Half the battle when feeling sick and tired is choosing what to eat &amp; then finding the necessary ingredients.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/06/pasta-dinner-gift-basket/pastagiftwrap/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/06/pastagiftwrap-575x382.jpg" alt="pasta gift wrap" title="pastagiftwrap" /></a></p>

<p>In our home, we love fresh produce, so when gifting a meal I try to include at least one fresh fruit or vegetable. I think most individuals are just as pleased to receive fresh healthy produce that can be added to any meal as they are to receive pre-cooked macaroni casseroles.</p>

<p>For a simple dinner your friend can assemble in a jiff, consider this pasta dinner gift basket complete with fresh green onions, tomato, garlic &amp; basil. Throw in a package or two of whole wheat pasta and a jar of olive oil and they are set for a healthy quick-fix meal.</p>

    <p>One of our good friends had his quarter century birthday this past week. To celebrate, his wife (Kristin) threw a small Scotch tasting party. Her decorations were so clever I had to snap a few photos to share with you.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/06/scotch-tasting-party/scotchtastingparty-3/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/06/scotchtastingparty-3-575x359.jpg" alt="scotch tasting party" title="scotchtastingparty (3)" /></a></p>

<p>Kristin set up five tasting stations, one for each region of Scotland–Campbeltown, Highlands, Lowlands, Speyside &amp; Islay. Each station had a different tartan plaid, grassy arrangement, picture of the area in Scotland from which that scotch hailed, and a framed sheet outlining the various characteristics of the scotch we were to taste.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/06/scotch-tasting-party/scotchtastingparty-1/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/06/scotchtastingparty-1-575x359.jpg" alt="" title="scotchtastingparty (1)" /></a></p>

<p>She also researched which foods paired well with each scotch and set those out at the appropriate stations (sushi, eggplant hummus, sushi, bread, olives, cheese, apples with cinnamon and honey, and chocolate-covered espresso beans).</p>

<p>A cute little make-your-own drinks station was set up in the kitchen, complete with grenadine flavors, Pellegrino and fruit. Yumm!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/06/scotch-tasting-party/scotchtastingparty/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/06/scotchtastingparty-575x359.jpg" alt="scotch tasting party" title="scotchtastingparty" /></a></p>

<p>Since I have a bit of a sweet tooth, my favorite part of the evening was the “You Make Me Want to Stout” cupcakes. Absolutely incredible award-winning cupcake recipe. It used three different types of beer, one for the cake, one for the filling and one for the frosting–seriously, how can you go wrong?</p>

<p>This was a very enjoyable birthday celebration and so fitting for someone turning 25. I hope Kristin’s genius party planning serves as inspiration when gearing up for your next event.</p>

    <p>Today was another glorious Friday out at <a href="http://www.auntwillieswildflowers.com">Aunt Willie’s Wildflowers</a>. With no weddings on the books this weekend, we were able to devote ourselves fully to the task of arranging bucket upon bucket of market bouquets for the Kingsport Farmer’s Market. Linda’s customers will be SO happy.</p>

<p>Beautiful flowers to work with, beautiful weather to work in, beautiful scenery surrounding our work space, all in all a fantastic way to end the week. Here are a few photos of the flowers we had to work with this week.</p>

    <p>I’ve recently become slightly obsessed with straws. I see them everywhere and they are so enticing with their bright colors, fun designs and cheap price tag. I picked up a pack of 100 fluorescent straws for a grand total of $.99 this week. I have a couple ideas in mind for these straws but for today, I chose to incorporate them into my gift wrap.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/06/blue-red-straw-gift-wrap/blueandredgiftwrap-6/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/06/blueandredgiftwrap-6-575x382.jpg" alt="" title="blueandredgiftwrap (6)" /></a></p>

<p>I simply placed one strip of double sided tape across the top of a wrapped box. Then I lined the straws up so they covered the top of the box. After the top of my box was covered, I wrapped a red ribbon around the box and straws and hot glued a blue flower on top. That’s it. The entire wrapping process took about 10 minutes.</p>

    <p>This past week, the flower farm crew learned to stretch our imaginations a little bit farther than usual. This was the first time we were asked to arrange two weddings on the same day, and to make it a bit more interesting…two vastly different color palettes and settings.</p>

<p><em>Wedding #1:</em> flowy, wild &amp; bright; different flowers for each bouquet, outdoor wedding<br />
Flowers: grasses, mint, sunflowers, larkspur, black-eyed susans, lilies, bells of ireland, feverfew, campanula, and more.</p>

<p><em>Wedding #2:</em> neat, rounded bouquets, specific color pallet: periwinkle and raspberry, continuity across bouquets&amp; arrangements<br />
Flowers: blue, white and pink hydrangea (we even spray-painted a few–yes, this is an option), hot pink roses, snapdragons, holly, feverfew</p>

<p>We also made a grand total of 23 boutonnieres this week (trust me, that’s a lot).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/06/wedding-flower-girl-headband/flowergirlheadband/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/06/flowergirlheadband-325x419.jpg" alt="Flower Girl Headband Bright Colors" title="flowergirlheadband" /></a></p>

<p>Although vastly different in flowers and setting, both weddings were quite beautiful. My absolute favorite part of arranging these weddings, however, was the flower girl headbands. And, of course, I never took a finished photo of the pieces (grr). However, if you will excuse the sad, unfinished photos I can show you the headbands minus the ribbon.</p>

<p>I picked up these plastic headbands with a thin layer of foam on top in Walmart’s craft section for $1.17. To attach the flowers, I simply arranged two small grouping of flowers and greens in my hand and wrapped the stems with florist tape, as you would a boutonniere.</p>

<p>Next, I placed the larger grouping higher on the side of the headband, stem-ends facing down (toward your ear) and attached it to the headband by wrapping the stems to the band with florist tape. Then I took the smaller grouping and attached it to the band with stems facing up (toward the top of your head) and sort-of wedged under the flowers of the first grouping. So, the two flower bunches are facing each other (you can see the shape we are going for in the photo of Kristin’s yellow headband).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/06/wedding-flower-girl-headband/flowergirlheadband-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/06/flowergirlheadband1-325x216.jpg" alt="Flower Girl headband muted colors" title="flowergirlheadband" /></a></p>

<p>The last step, not shown here, is to wrap the ribbon of your choosing around the rest of the head band. I made a small knot under the edge of the flowers on each side (so it can’t be seen) and continued to wrap down toward the ends of the headband where I tied off the ribbon with another small knot.</p>

<p>I know that sounds a bit confusing but once you start the process, it comes pretty naturally. The brightly-colored headband is the one I made, the muted yellow one was made by my good friend Kristin who keeps me sane on those days I can’t seem to find a rhythm to my arranging. Don’t we all need one of those friends? I hope this has been an enjoyable read for you. Best of luck!</p>

    <p>The next time you bring a bottle of wine to a dinner party consider dressing up the bag to make your contribution stand out. That’s right, just dress up the plain boring paper bag from the store. All it takes is a small segment of lace, a glue gun, and, if you feel like going the extra mile, a section of ribbon.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/06/wine-bottle-lace-gift-wrap/winebottlegiftwrap-1/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/06/winebottlegiftwrap-1-575x382.jpg" alt="" title="winebottlegiftwrap (1)" /></a></p>

<p>Simply start at the bottom of the bag (with wine inside) and work your way up the bottle at a diagonal angle, gluing the edge of the lace or ribbon as you circle the bag. I also took a match and burned the top edges of the paper bag for the finishing touch.</p>

    <p>Hello friends, Jack and I just got back from a mini-vacation to see the family–at least some of them. So, to make up for missing Floral Friday, here is a little post on a beautiful and bold wedding arrangement made for a bright wedding two weeks ago.</p>

<p>Seriously, isn’t this arrangement gorgeous?!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/06/bold-bright-wedding-arrangement/brightweddingflowers-1/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/06/brightweddingflowers-1-325x488.jpg" alt="Bright Wedding Flower Arrangement" title="brightweddingflowers (1)" /></a></p>

<p>I can’t get over how simple and breathtaking these flowers are, and so simple. Some of my favorite flowers are the ones that grow in mixed colors, you see this effect with flowers like Dahlias, which no one can deny they are beautiful. However, there is something about the pure colors–especially pure and bold like this arrangement.</p>

<p>This arrangement began in a pastel-colored pitcher but we discovered white was the only way to go. The flowers are gorgeous on their own and a colored pitcher didn’t make as big of a statement. Here’s another picture for you.</p>

<p><em>Stems:</em></p>

<p>Pink Peonies<br />
Magenta Snapdragons<br />
White Snapdragons<br />
Blue Delphinium<br />
Sunflowers<br />
Hosta Leaves<br />
Bells of Ireland<br />
Ornamental Grasses</p>

<p><em>Arrangement:</em></p>

<p>This arrangement starts out a bit different from what I normally recommend. There is not much filler used so I would start with your tall stems that are used most, in this case the snapdragons. Next, add in the little bit of filler–Bells of Ireland (the green things that look like bells–just in case you needed help with that).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/06/bold-bright-wedding-arrangement/brightweddingflowers-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/06/brightweddingflowers-2-575x382.jpg" alt="Bright Wedding Flower Arrangement" title="brightweddingflowers (2)" /></a></p>

<p>Now we need to focus on pulling the eye downward. Start by placing pink peonies low in the arrangement, nearly to the vase rim. The sunflowers have large stems so I would cut those lower than the snaps but higher than the peonies. Make sure you don’t cut them all the exact same height, you want these to be varied throughout the middle third of the arrangement height. Add these next since they will fill large holes and take up much of the vase space.</p>

<p>Now you can add the delicate-stemmed delphinium for beautiful pops of bluish-purple color. Finally add the Hosta leaves around the rim of the vase, as if cradling the peonies. Hosta leaves give the eye an end point for the arrangement.</p>

<p>I hope you all enjoyed your holiday weekend. Ours was absolutely wonderful–gorgeous weather, great friends, and good food–what more can a girl ask for?</p>

<p>This week we will be staying with a friend as we make the trek up to see my parents. I decided our brief overnight stay required a little thank-you treat. I decided to bake mini lemon cupcakes (you know in those tiny cupcake liners–so cute!). Anyways, I needed a good way to dress up the gift bag. Here’s what I came up with on the fly.</p>

<p>I started with this little blue bag to hold my mini treats. Prior to filling the bag, I used a glue stick to attach a mini doily to the front. Then I filled the bag with treats and tied an aqua bow around the bag to finish off the gift bag decor.</p>

<p>That’s it, a quick and simple way to spruce up small gift decor.</p>

    <p>Hello friends! I hope you are all out enjoying your holiday weekend. This weekend the hubby and I decided to throw a last-minute Memorial Day BBQ for a few friends. I didn’t have much time to prep but I thought I should still throw together a few decorations for the event.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/05/memorial-day-decorative-paper-flags/paperflagsticks/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/05/paperflagsticks-325x453.jpg" alt="paper flag sticks Memorial Day" title="paperflagsticks" /></a></p>

<p>These fun paper flags are great for either adding color to your table or labeling your food (just stick straight into your dish). If you are baking a Memorial Day cake, consider frosting the outside with white icing and adding the red and blue flag sticks on top in varying heights.</p>

<p>You can also add ribbon to your skewers or dip the edges of the paper into glue and coat in glitter. The possibilities are endless.</p>

<p>The simple version pictured above uses two pieces of 8-1/2 x 11 inch paper. Cut 1-inch strips across the narrow side of your paper. Then fold in half and cut to a point at the end. Last step–use double-sided tape to attach the paper flags to the skewers (just wrap it around the stick). That’s all it takes for these easy-peasy paper flags.</p>

<p>Hope you all have a very relaxing Memorial Day!</p>

    <p>A few weeks ago I had the privilege of helping Linda with flower arrangements for a vintage wedding. If you haven’t figured it out before, it seems the go-to flower for vintage is the beautiful peony. And really, who would argue with that choice? The peony is absolutely exquisite in all colors but this coral color is by far my favorite. I could look at it for hours. Really? Not even kidding.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/05/coral-peony-bridal-bouquet/antiquewedding-3/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/05/antiquewedding-3-575x382.jpg" alt="" title="antiquewedding (3)" /></a></p>

<p>Here’s another look, in case you too, can’t stop staring.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/05/coral-peony-bridal-bouquet/antiquewedding-2-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/05/antiquewedding-2-575x382.jpg" alt="" title="antiquewedding (2)" /></a></p>

<p>Alrighty then, tearing eyes away, closing mouth, moving on…</p>

<p>The bridal bouquet was made mainly with white and coral peonies, white stock, yellow, white &amp; peach ranunculus, chartreuse-colored physocarpis, and bells of Ireland.</p>

<p>Bouquets are different than arrangements in styling order. With arrangements you typically want to start by placing your filler since that will take up more of the vase space. With bouquets however, filler is much more scarce so you actually begin with your flowers, and usually the bulkier flowers first to provide support to the smaller stems.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/05/coral-peony-bridal-bouquet/antiquewedding-5/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/05/antiquewedding-5-575x382.jpg" alt="" title="antiquewedding (5)" /></a></p>

<p>So, can you guess which flower we start with here? That’s right, the peonies! Group a few peonies in the middle, then add a white stock in between each peony. Then add a few Bells of Ireland stems around the edges of the peonies and stocks, follow with an outer layer of peonies in the open spaces.</p>

<p>As you move toward the outer edges of your bouquet, make sure you are continuing to push the outer edges upward instead of letting them fall low. With bridal and bridesmaid bouquets you want to see all of the flowers at the top, not lose them down underneath at the spot where you would hold the bouquet, make sense?</p>

<p>Alright, now all that’s left is filling in the spaces and adding a few pops of color and filler. This bouquet has Phisocarpus leaves placed sporadically throughout for a bit of added filler and little peach, white, and yellow Ranunculus for added color. Hold the bouquet lower on the stems as you add flowers. This allows the bouquet to sit loosely giving you plenty of wiggle room for adding stems in last minute or even pulling a few out.</p>

<p>And of course, if you like the look, add Hosta leaves around the very bottom to create a collar. This gives the eye an end point and keeps the focus on the flowers above the collar instead of trailing off into nothingness.</p>

    <p>I love gifts. I love giving them, getting them and especially wrapping them. Doesn’t a creative, well-wrapped gift make the exchanging of gifts so much more exciting?! Well, in honor of creative gift wrap (and just because I love it so much), we are starting an exciting new weekly posting: “The Wednesday Wrap” (or some other clever title that I have yet to come up with).</p>

<p>I will be posting a new wrapping idea each week in the hopes of inspiring a little gift-wrapping creativity. Hope you enjoy!</p>

<p><em>Materials:</em></p>

<p>Take-out Box (Michaels, $.99)<br />
Lavender Raffia (Michael’s, $.99 clearance bin)<br />
1 mini paper doily (WalMart, $.99 for a pack of 12)<br />
Purple Ribbon (Michael’s, $.99 clearance bin)</p>

    <p><em>Occasion:</em> Baby Shower with Unknown Baby Gender</p>

<p>Use this bouquet as inspiration for a baby shower with an unknown baby gender.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/?attachment_id=3990"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/05/DSC_0154-575x381.jpg" alt="" title="DSC_0154" /></a></p>

<p><em>Stems:</em></p>

<p>pink/burgundy dianthus<br />
burgundy ranunculi<br />
yellow ranunculi<br />
yellow stock<br />
blue baptisia</p>

<p><em>Arranging:</em></p>

<p>Begin with the dianthus as they are both sturdy and full so they will take up much of the empty space allowing you to strategically place the more delicate stems.</p>

<p>Next, add your contrasting colors, I put in two stems of yellow stock, one for height and color and a second to make the bouquet even. Accent the stock with yellow ranunculi spread throughout the arrangement in lower areas.</p>

<p>Fill any holes with the burgundy ranunculi. Pairing different flowers of similar colors in one bouquet gives the arrangement texture and dimension. Finally, add the tall stem(s) of baptisia. More stems of baptisia will give you a more obvious boy/girl theme or you can find another bluish flower to add to the mix like ageratum.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/05/baby-shower-flowers-painted-jars/paintedballjar-3/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/05/paintedballjar-3-575x382.jpg" alt="paintedballjar" title="paintedballjar (3)" /></a></p>

<p><em>Centerpiece:</em></p>

<p>Take four ball jars (or a variety of used jars from your pantry) and paint the inside of each with a different pastel shade: yellow, blue, pink, green, etc. If you don’t have any pastel paints on hand, just mix each color with white until you reach the desired shade.</p>

<p>The first coat does a good job of filling in all white/clear space on the jar, however, if placed in the light it shows the stroke lines of your brush. I tried using a normal painter’s brush as well as one of those Styrofoam tipped brushes, but the regular brush worked much better. Wait 20 minutes for the first coat to dry before painting a second coat that hides the original brush strokes.</p>

<p>Make arrangements to place in your painted jars from the flowers listed above. Add three hosta leaves around the jar rims to form a collar. Group the jars in the center of the table for a beautiful bold centerpiece.</p>

<p>Painting the jars took about 30 minutes total so don’t be deterred by the extra effort of painting clear jars instead of buying colored vases/jars. Trust me, the extra time is well worth your efforts and will not go unnoticed.</p>

    <p>Working on a farm in the summer, in Tennessee, tends to get a little hot and a <em>lot</em> humid. I wish I could say I’ve become accustomed to the humidity but every time I think I’m beginning to adjust, the summer ends and we start the adjustment process all over again the following year.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/05/tee-to-tank-tutorial/teetotanktutorial-23/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/05/teetotanktutorial-23-325x424.jpg" alt="" title="teetotanktutorial (23)" /></a></p>

<p>Is there a point to me rambling about the heat? Why yes, now that you mention it, there is…working on a farm you learn quickly the value of wearing long pants and long-sleeved t-shirts to stay cool and keep yourself protected. Unfortunately, I’ve never been able to handle the long-sleeved t-shirt. Maybe its psychological but it feels SO HOT. Instead, I opt for tank tops, lots and lots of tank tops. Of course, that means a lot of shirts end up ruined. I decided this summer, I had to come up with cheaper dispensable farm clothes.</p>

<p>I saw this tee to tank tutorail on <a href="http://www.crafterhoursblog.com/2011/08/tee-to-tank-tutorial-by-jen-from.html">Crafterhours</a>, but the idea is from <a href="http://upcyclededucation.blogspot.com/">Upcycled Education</a>. Here’s my own little documented attempt at the tank.</p>

<p>First, choose an over-sized t-shirt that you never wear (mine was a $3 pink craft tee from Michaels).</p>

<p>Next, make your cuts.<br />
Cut #1: Lay the t-shirt flat and cut off the sleeves just inside the seam.<br />
Cut #2: Cut a straight line across the top of the shirt just under the neck.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/05/tee-to-tank-tutorial/teetotanktutorial-18/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/05/teetotanktutorial-18-575x382.jpg" alt="" title="teetotanktutorial (18)" /></a></p>

<p>Cut #3: Cut the bottom seam off the tshirt plus another small strip immediately above. The strip with the seam you can throw away, the second strip needs to be cut into 2 equal strips.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/05/tee-to-tank-tutorial/teetotanktutorial-19/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/05/teetotanktutorial-19-575x383.jpg" alt="" title="teetotanktutorial (19)" /></a></p>

<p>If your tee is a bit too large, as mine was, turn it inside out and lay it flat. Place pins 1/2 inch inside the original side seam all the way up to the armpit on both sides. Sew along the pins. Remove excess fabric and turn right side out. Tada!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/05/tee-to-tank-tutorial/teetotanktutorial-21/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/05/teetotanktutorial-21-575x382.jpg" alt="" title="teetotanktutorial (21)" /></a></p>

<p>Hem the top edges of the tee, leaving a 1/2 inch loop. Once the hem is sewn, thread one of the fabric strips from the bottom of the tee through each hem loop. I poke the end of a skewer through the fabric strip and pushed it through the loop, however, the smarter method would be to place the fabric strip on the shirt edge before folding it over for the hem.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/05/tee-to-tank-tutorial/teetotanktutorial-20/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/05/teetotanktutorial-20-575x382.jpg" alt="" title="teetotanktutorial (20)" /></a></p>

<p>All that’s left is putting on your newly fashioned tank and tying the front and back ties together at the height that suits you best. There are lots of ways to tie the drawstring so put on your creativity cap.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/05/tee-to-tank-tutorial/teetotanktutorial-22/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/05/teetotanktutorial-22-575x382.jpg" alt="" title="teetotanktutorial (22)" /></a></p>

<p>That’s it–a $3 tee shirt turned tank that’s loose, comfy and won’t bum me out if it gets ruined on the farm. Tomorrow I’m planning to turn some large print tees into work shirts too, I’ll share pictures soon.</p>

<p>Be sure to head over to <a href="http://upcyclededucation.blogspot.com/">Upcycled Education</a> and thank Jen for the great tutorial inspiration and check out the actual tutorial on <a href="http://www.crafterhoursblog.com/2011/08/tee-to-tank-tutorial-by-jen-from.html">Crafterhours</a>.</p>

    <p>Happy Mother’s Day to all you moms out there. Today is one of my favorite days because I love my mother so very much and I love having an entire day set aside for the sole purpose of honoring and celebrating her life, the sacrifices she has made and the person she is today.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/05/mothers-day-small-tribute/antiquewedding/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/05/antiquewedding-575x382.jpg" alt="" title="antiquewedding" /></a></p>

<p>My mom was recently offered a job in the Chicago area, a career opportunity of a lifetime for her. After much deliberation and conversation with my father, they decided she should take advantage of this opportunity, even though it means leaving my dad back home in Oregon until he can retire.</p>

<p>While this decision may sound crazy to most, and at times to our little family as well, I couldn’t be more proud of my mom. None of the decisions she and my father had to make regarding this position were easy. Moving across the U.S. to live alone, leaving the home you’ve poured so much time and effort into in exchange for a small apartment, trading the beautiful greenery and mountain settings of Oregon for the “concrete jungle” of a big city, and of course leaving behind all those you love most to pursue a dream that may or may not pan out…</p>

<p>I know many of you understand what it takes to make difficult decisions like these so you understand what must have gone into making the final decision to move. Despite all the so-called-craziness of this move, I am so proud that my mom took the job. She recognized the rut she was in, the day-in-day-out dead end job (you know the kind), and she took a chance. A very big chance. Decisions like these are the ones that make me respect my mother. Of course, no parent is ever perfect but it is always in the critical moments that I truly appreciate the example she sets.</p>

<p>My mother didn’t just tell my sister and I to follow our dreams and shoot for the stars, she didn’t just tell us to hold our heads high and put forth our best effort, she didn’t just tell us how to be strong confident women–she <em>showed</em> us. She showed us all these things when we were young and she continues to show us still today.</p>

<p>I am so proud of my mom and so grateful for her presence in my life, a gift not all can claim. I am grateful for the example she has set for me throughout the years, the encouragement she gives through every endeavor I undertake, the pride she takes in her family and in her work, her adventurous spirit and her persistent attitude. I am grateful that my mom has taught me to be confident in who I am, be proud of where I come from and to never give up on my dreams.</p>

<p>Thank you mom for all you do and all you have done for our family throughout the years. You do not go unnoticed. We love you more and more each and every day.</p>

    <p>Curry is a seriously under appreciated seasoning. While living in Ukraine, I learned many unconventional ways to incorporate curry into everyday recipes. One of my absolute favorite curry recipes is this curry egg salad.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/05/curry-egg-salad-sandwich/dsc_0041-001/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/05/DSC_0041-001-575x381.jpg" alt="" title="Curry Egg Salad" /></a></p>

<p><em>Ingredients:</em></p>

<p>3 hard-boiled eggs<br />
2 tbsp miracle whip (or mayo)<br />
3 green onions (chopped)<br />
2 tsp curry<br />
pepper<br />
1 leaf of lettuce<br />
1 slice of wheat bread</p>

<p><em>Directions:</em></p>

<p>Boil the eggs and allow to cool. Chop the eggs into smaller pieces and place in a small bowl. Add onions, curry, and miracle whip to the bowl. Toast your bread slice. Add a slice of lettuce, the egg salad and a dash of pepper on top.</p>

<p>That’s it. One incredibly simple curried egg salad recipe. All that’s left is digging in! What’s your favorite curry recipe?</p>

    <p>We all have those favorite flowers, you know the ones you wait anxiously for all year and then it seems as soon as they bloom they wilt away once more. For me, the gorgeous peony is the flower I most look forward to at the beginning of the flower season. Unfortunately, it seems these flowers are gone before I can be out on the farm enjoying their beauty.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/05/how-to-preserve-peonies/farmflowers-40/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/05/farmflowers-40-575x382.jpg" alt="peonies" title="farmflowers (40)" /></a></p>

<p>Linda, however, has taught me a few tricks for making peonies last. The peony is a popular flower for weddings so every year we make these beauties last a bit longer by cutting them early and letting them hibernate in the fridge for a few weeks.</p>

<p>For those of you who want to save your peonies for a big event or simply want to keep them around longer to brighten up your home, you can follow these simple steps to preserving peonies.<br />
_<br />
How to Preserve Peonies:_</p>

<p>1.) Cut peonies when they are in the “marshmallow” stage. Squeeze the bud and if it feels like a marshmallow, they are ready to cut and store. The image below is just before marshmallow stage.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/farm-photos/farmflowers-33-copy/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/05/farmflowers-33-Copy-575x382.jpg" alt="" title="farmflowers (33) - Copy" /></a></p>

<p>2.) Next, place a bunch of peony stems in double-layered newspaper. The image below <em>is</em> marshmallow stage.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/05/how-to-preserve-peonies/farmflowers-42/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/05/farmflowers-42-575x382.jpg" alt="" title="farmflowers (42)" /></a></p>

<p>3.) Wrap the newspaper around the stems.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/05/how-to-preserve-peonies/farmflowers-43/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/05/farmflowers-43-575x410.jpg" alt="" title="farmflowers (43)" /></a></p>

<p>4.) Place in a refrigerator to hibernate up to 1 month.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/05/how-to-preserve-peonies/farmflowers-44/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/05/farmflowers-44-575x382.jpg" alt="" title="farmflowers (44)" /></a></p>

<p>When you pull the peonies out again, they will look slightly less perfect than when you put them in but just place them in water and in a few hours they will start to open up. The only downside to preserving peonies is that their shelf-life post-refrigeration is less than if they were freshly cut–about two days.</p>

<p>Let us know if you have any questions!</p>

    <p>After a rigorous year of classes, I can finally say my hardest year of nursing school is complete! Today was my last final and I can’t express how much relief I am feeling right now. Here’s a small glimpse into my life these past few weeks… as if finals aren’t bad enough with cumulative nursing tests, we had a grand total of 12 tests piled on for our last three weeks of classes. Can we say “insane?!” That’s what I thought. Anyways, it is over and I am relieved and ready to finally be in my final year of nursing. This degree (and the attempted others) has been a very long time in the making and I am so excited to be so close to the finish line.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/05/lazy-chocolate-spice-cake/chocolatespicecake-1/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/05/chocolatespicecake-1-575x410.jpg" alt="" title="chocolatespicecake (1)" /></a></p>

<p>Now, I say all these details about my finals to butter you up since my posts the last few weeks have been scattered and brief. But guess what? All that is about to change! Jack is helping me with some exciting changes for the blog including, a new title and domain, new categories, design changes and hopefully a much better posting schedule. You can look forward to all these changes taking place in about a month (poor Jack still has classes to finish).</p>

<p>Now on to the fun stuff…</p>

<p>This weekend, in the midst of all my studying, I had one of those moments where I simply couldn’t go a minute longer with being crafty. I settled for baking since it is quick and I get to enjoy it for days to come (this cake didn’t last that long). Since I was short on time I cheated and brought out a boxed (<em>gasp</em>), yes, <em>boxed</em> Dunkin Hynes spice cake. Of course, I couldn’t <em>just</em> make a boxed cake so I added 2 tbsp of chocolate baking powder and 2 tsp of vanilla. I then added all the ingredients on the back of the box (3 eggs, oil, water) and threw it in the oven for 25 minutes.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/05/lazy-chocolate-spice-cake/chocolatespicecake-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/05/chocolatespicecake-2-575x382.jpg" alt="" title="chocolatespicecake (2)" /></a></p>

<p>This was a <em>huge</em> success. I really wasn’t expecting much out of this haphazard baking attempt but the finished result was tasty and moist–really, what else matters? I also had half of a package of cream cheese in the fridge so I softened the block, added about 1-1/2 cups of powdered sugar, 2 tsp of vanilla and a smidge of milk. And voila! Delicious cream cheese frosting (spread between the cake layers). Chocolate spice cake, cream cheese frosting, pear slices on top–trust me, this is a winning combination.</p>

<p>So there you have it, my lazy chocolate spice cake for those of you with crazy lives like mine. Keep checking back with us, lots of fun projects coming up. Happy baking!</p>

<p>There are a few basic methods to arranging flowers. For an arrangement like the one shown above, it is best to start with your bulky flowers (the white lilacs) as those take up a lot of space and make filling in the rest of the arrangement fairly simple. Place 3-5 stems of lilacs of varying heights in your container–the number of stems depends on their size and the size of your container. Angle each stem in a different direction (or if they are smaller you can try grouping).</p>

<p>With an arrangement this size I would next fill in with greenery to add support and stability to your lilacs, also providing a sturdy base for the more delicate flowers. The greenery in this arrangement is simply the drooping foliage from a lilac bush on the farm. Make sure you add greenery both around the lip of the container, giving it the spillover effect, as well as tall and short stems in and around the lilacs to add dimension.</p>

<p>Next, add your color. This is usually a more delicate stem, so be sure to place gently and secure well amid the greenery. Linda used tulips for her color.</p>

<p>Finally, in order to really make the tulips stand out, Linda added a chartreuse color of greenery to the mix. Chartreuse greenery is one of my all-time favorite items to add to arrangements. Although dark greenery is pretty, it is still dark, making your one bright color a big leap from the dark green. The chartreuse color bridges this dark-light gap and allows the brightness of the flower to pop while keeping the overall arrangement in balance. The chartreuse-colored stem in this arrangement is physocarpus.</p>

<p>The wonderful thing about this arrangement is most people with a garden have these flowers. The flowers are not anything out of the ordinary and you can substitute the greenery with just about any shrub or decorative grass in your own backyard.</p>

<p>I hope you’ve enjoyed these quick and simple steps to building a beautiful flower arrangement for your home. Happy arranging!</p>

    <p>“As I look backward over a long checkered life, it seems to me that the hand of God has been weaving a beautiful pattern of many colors and shapes for me and for the people who have been and who will be associated with me.” -Leona Auer</p>

    <p>A few pictures from dad’s annual golf trip with his brother and brother-in-law.</p>

<p>Instead of Idaho, this year’s trip was spent in North Carolina, which meant the hubby and I were able to join the golfing fun over Easter weekend.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/04/easter-golf/golftrip-12/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/04/golftrip-12-575x382.jpg" alt="The trio" title="golftrip (12)" /></a></p>

<p>Jake joined the boys in two 18-hole rounds of golf each day while I attempted to soak up as much sun as possible while driving around the cart.</p>

    <p>Today was another Bird’s Nest workshop out at <a href="http://www.auntwillieswildflowers.com">Aunt Willie’s Wildlflowers</a>. These are just a few of the photos from the day. We ate a delicious pasta salad, rolls, and strawberry almond salad. So healthy!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/03/bird-nest-workshop/birds-nest-ws-20121-001/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/03/Birds-Nest-WS-20121-001-575x359.jpg" alt="" title="Bird's Nest WS 2012-3" /></a></p>

<p>Everything on the farm is blooming early thanks to our mild winter so there are more flowers than usual right now. This is wonderful for viewing, not so great for the upcoming wedding season. I suppose we can’t complain too much with all these beauties.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/03/bird-nest-workshop/birds-nest-ws-2012/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/03/Birds-Nest-WS-2012-575x359.jpg" alt="" title="Bird's Nest WS 2012" /></a></p>

<p>These handcrafted bird’s nest are the perfect table decoration for your upcoming Easter get-together. Check out how to make one for yourself and be sure to view more photos from the day over on our <a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/farm-photos/">“Farm Photos”</a> tab.</p>

<p><em>Supplies:</em></p>

<p>1 small straw wreath<br />
1 cardboard circle that matches the wreath size<br />
1 spool of paddle wire<br />
1 small bag of fake moss<br />
1 bag of two-pronged pins<br />
moss, nuts, dried flowers, lichen, and any other decoration from nature you can think of</p>

<p><em>Instructions:</em></p>

<p>1. Take your fake moss and cover the straw wreath, wrapping it loosely with paddle wire as you move around the wreath. Twist the paddle wire together once the entire wreath is covered. You really just need to make sure no straw is showing on the sides because the real moss will cover the top of the wreath.<br />
2. Using hot glue, attach the cardboard circle to the bottom of your wreath. This will keep your moss and pretties from falling through.<br />
3. Take various colors and textures of moss and fill the wreath hole and various parts of the top of your wreath. You can use as much or as little moss as you’d like for this part. One of our farm ladies today covered her entire wreath in moss and other just had little trails of moss coming out of the center and over the edges.<br />
4. Now use dried hydrangea, daffodils, dogwood, nuts, lichen, twigs, wheat, grasses and anything else you can find to decorate the rim of your nest. This year, I used blue hydrangea bunches on each side, pussy willow branches, feathers, dried pods, larkspur, and artemisia to decorate.<br />
5. Once all your decor is secured in place with pins or hot glue, drop in a few candy eggs and your bird’s nest is complete!</p>

    <p>It never ceases to amaze me how much I don’t know about life. Every day brings new challenges, new joys and new adventures. Some days it feels as though this rocky rollercoaster that we are on just won’t stop. And the funny thing is, when it does stop, or at least pauses for a moment, that’s the moment when I feel most excited for the next big drop.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/03/change-acceptance/christmas-pics-023/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/03/Christmas-Pics-023-575x426.jpg" alt="" title="Christmas Pics 023" /></a></p>

<p>The hubby and I have been married for 4 years this May and our married life, as in our dating life, is full of never-ending surprises. We have frustrating daily surprises like broken down cars and doctor bills. Yet, at the same time, we are constantly being blessed with meals to get us through finals week or an unexpected check in the mail to treat ourselves to a night out. These past four years we have come to realize time and time again just how great God is and how blessed we are in Him.</p>

<p>These past few weeks it seems everyone in our family has had to make difficult decisions and come to some unexpected conclusions (more on this soon). When this happens, my usual response is to curl up in a ball and hide under the covers. To a certain degree I could get away with this while living under my parents’ roof. However, when the roof is your own, you have to put on your big girl pants and man up. This is not the easiest of lessons to learn and I constantly feel as if my progress is in a two steps forward, one step back rhythm. However, I suppose as long as I’m moving forward in the long-run, I’m doing alright.</p>

<p>Anyways, the point is, when so much change takes place at once, it sometimes easy to lose focus and forget what’s really important. This time next year, we could be moving to one of 7 cities if the hubby gets into a PhD school. If he doesn’t get in, we can go wherever we want, which is definitely the more terrifying option for me. You want me to choose from anything I want? And… cue meltdown.</p>

<p>So, what should I be doing now? Well, the hubby will be applying to schools in the Fall and I will most likely be applying to graduate programs or jobs (or both) in those cities as well. We won’t know anything until March next year, a mere 2 months before graduation, so until then I have a few options…</p>

<p><em>Option #1:</em> Panic and overthink every possible situation that may arise.<br />
<em>Option #2:</em> Panic and curl up under the covers. (My favorite)<br />
<em>Option #3:</em> Know that the next year will continue to be a riveting rollercoaster of a ride, enjoy the ride, and trust that whatever comes next will be exhilarating, worthwhile and right.</p>

<p>Yeah, I know, number three is the winner, it sounds so simple and yet we all know it’s so much easier said than done. However, that is where I am choosing to put my focus–waiting and trusting that what is meant to be, will be, one way or another. Like I said at the beginning, I know very little about life so why waste time trying to decipher every last detail when I could be enjoying them all.</p>

<p>If you’ve made it this far, I thank you from the bottom of my heart for sticking with me through this brief hiatus from our usual postings. After a long and taxing week, writing out my scrambled thoughts has a very therapeutic effect. Perhaps you too find yourself facing unexpected changes today. If that’s the case, I encourage you to stand strong and keep pushing forward.</p>

    <p>The Milligan library held their second annual Edible Books Festival this week (<a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/04/edible-books-festival/">year #1 here</a>). My contributions included a “Holes” carrot cake made with graham crackers, coffee frosting and cinnamon as well as a “Tortoise and the Hare” watermelon turtle, complete with <em>hair</em>-get it? I crack myself up.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/03/watermelon-turtle-edible-books/watermelonturtle3/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/03/watermelonturtle3-575x382.jpg" alt="" title="watermelonturtle3" /></a></p>

<p>Anywho, I thought I’d share a few quick and dirty instructions for carving Mr. Turtle. I’ve seen several versions of this turtle but the one at <a href="http://rhondas3boys.blogspot.com/2010/06/watermelon-turtle.html">Down Memory Lane</a> is my favorite.</p>

<p><em>Instructions:</em><br />
1. Cut watermelon in half along the longer line.</p>

<p>2. Use a melon-baller, or if you don’t have one (like me) use a metal measuring spoon-1/4 tsp, and scoop out as much watermelon as possible.</p>

<p>3. Scrape all remnants of the watermelon out of each side.</p>

<p>4. Take one side of the watermelon, and draw an oval-shaped shell, four feet, and a head with a dry-erase marker (dry-erase makes it easy to wipe off once you’re done carving).</p>

<p>5. Carve out your shapes.</p>

<p>6. With a flat head screwdriver, carve out the lines on your shell. If you are afraid to eyeball it, use the dry erase marker to draw your shapes. I basically just dragged the flat edge back and forth to make the lines–took about 15 minutes total.</p>

<p>7. Poke two small holes in the head and poke in two whole peppercorns for eyes.</p>

<p>8. Use toothpicks to secure your legs and head to the shell.</p>

<p>9. All that’s left is filling the non-shell side with fruit (and adding strawberry-leaf hair if desired). I used the previously scooped melon balls, strawberries and grapes as filling.</p>

<p>This turtle is really easy to make and adds a fun element to any party.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/03/watermelon-turtle-edible-books/holes-cake/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/03/holes-cake-325x216.jpg" alt="" title="holes cake" /></a>Here’s a little shot of the carrot “Holes” cake. I basically just used a round cookie cutter to make the holes, crumbled the cake into piles and added ground-up graham crackers so it looked more textured and desert-like. I also sprinkled cinnamon into the holes and on one side of the mounds to act as a sort of shading. The “shovels” are broken wood skewers and the rocks are ginger candies.</p>

<p>Some of my other favorites from Edible Books 2012 were “Where’s Wal-dough” (cookie people with Waldo hiding among them) by Grace Jackson, “Pigs in Heaven” (a plate of bacon) by Seth and Stacey Tramel, and “Book of Fungi” with meringue mushrooms (I totally thought they were real mushrooms) by Meredith Sommers.</p>

<p>If you ever have the opportunity to bake for an Edible Books event, DO IT! It’s so much fun! I hope you’ve enjoyed this little tutorial. Let us know how your watermelons turn out. Happy carving!</p>

<p>All the beautiful sunshine this past week has made me a very happy camper. Nothing brings a smile to my face more quickly than waking up to rays of sunshine streaming through my bedroom window in the morning–nothing except maybe this sweet little poster from <a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/sevenstar?utm_source=convo&amp;utm_medium=trans_email&amp;utm_campaign=convo_html&amp;page=1">Elisandra Sevenstar’s Etsy Shop</a>.</p>

<p>I have seen this popular design popping up all over Pinterest and was finally able to trace it back to the source. Elisandra’s ETSY store has some wonderful designs that are both colorful and cheerful.</p>

<p>The “be so happy” whale is definitely my favorite and, along with the sunshine, never fails to bring a smile to my face.</p>

<p>Be sure to stop by her ETSY site or <a href="http://elisandraillustration.wordpress.com/">website</a> and show her some love.</p>

<p>Be happy!</p>

    <p>When individuals think about that moist, delicious, classic chocolate chip cookie, they typically don’t think <em>wheat</em>. However, ever since the hubby went on a wheat bread craze, we’ve had a lot of wheat flour in the house. Last year, he decided to try out some wheat chocolate chip cookies and we’ve loved the combination of chocolate and wheat ever since. So delicious!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/03/wheat-chocolate-chip-cookie-recipe/dsc_0036/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/03/DSC_0036-575x460.jpg" alt="" title="wheat chocolate chip cookies" /></a></p>

<p>I needed a batch of cookies in a hurry this afternoon so I went to a never-fail baker–good ol’ betty Crocker.

<p>I love history. I am by no means an expert but I love it none-the-less. Living in a region that is so full of rich history has been a truly eye-opening experience. One of our early finds after moving to East Tennessee was this small, charming state park that is literally 45 seconds from our home.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/03/sycamore-shoals-nature-photography/sycamore-shoals-9/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/03/Sycamore-Shoals-9-575x382.jpg" alt="" title="Sycamore Shoals- (9)" /></a></p>

<p>Sycamore Shoals State Park was part of the earliest settlement outside the 13 original English colonies. It was made famous by what we deem the Muster of the Overmountain Men. The “overmountain” nickname refers to the fact that their settlement was west of the Appalachians, or “over” the mountains, if you will. At the time the Appalachians were the primary geographical boundary that divided the colonies from the west. Their settlement over the mountain opened the door to the ensuing years westward expansion.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/03/sycamore-shoals-nature-photography/sycamore-shoals-7/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/03/Sycamore-Shoals-7-575x382.jpg" alt="" title="Sycamore Shoals- (7)" /></a></p>

<p>Pretty neat, huh? Well, all this to say, we love the park. The walking trail runs right along the river’s edge and is absolutely beautiful year round.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/03/sycamore-shoals-nature-photography/sycamore-shoals-1/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/03/Sycamore-Shoals-1-575x382.jpg" alt="" title="Sycamore Shoals- (1)" /></a></p>

<p>Jack and I spend many after-dinner hours down at the park taking in the splendors of creation (and walking off our very full tummies). Spring is one of our favorite times to explore the park because we feel like little kids discovering some great wonder for the very first time.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/03/sycamore-shoals-nature-photography/sycamore-shoals-5/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/03/Sycamore-Shoals-5-575x382.jpg" alt="" title="Sycamore Shoals- (5)" /></a></p>

<p>I decided to snap a few photos this week to give you all a small glimpse of the beautiful new growths taking root down at the Shoals. I hope you’ve enjoyed this glimpse into our historic little corner of the world.</p>

    <p>Spring is in the air here in East Tennessee and our household is gearing up for another attempt at container gardening. Although we love our little apartment, one very unfortunate downside is the inability to put our budding green thumbs to work. Since Jack and I very much enjoy the labors of tending a garden, we had to figure out a way to make due without a plot of land.</p>

<p>Our first year in Tennessee, we purchased a few inexpensive starter pots for a bit of trial and error in East Tennessee growing. The second year, we got smarter. We borrowed three large cylinder buckets from Linda out at <a href="http://www.auntwillieswildflowers.com">Aunt Willies Wildflowers</a> that were deep enough to allow better root growth for larger plants. The buckets aren’t pretty but our tomatoes grew much bigger and stronger because of them. We also attempted to put together our <a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/diy-planter-box/">first planter box</a>. When this project was attempted however, Jack did not own his own saw or a decent drill so we relied heavily on the great staff over at Home Depot to make the appropriate cuts for us.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/03/how-to-build-a-planter-box/planter-box-1/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/03/planter-box-1-325x403.jpg" alt="" title="planter-box-1" /></a></p>

<p>This last Christmas, Jack was gifted a new saw and drill (you can imagine how much our neighbors are loving us this Spring). Jack’s biggest goal with his new toys has been building wall book shelves that work around his desk. This is a slow process and we have had some extra wood pieces lying around the house because of the project. Last weekend, with the beautiful weather beckoning us outdoors, we decided to get the porch ready for planting and since we had the materials, we decided to build our second planter box too. This one is WAY better!</p>

<p>I asked the lovely husband to write up these simple instructions for those of you looking to container garden this spring.<br />
Please don’t hesitate to shoot us an email if you have any questions.</p>
<nbsp>  
_Tools &amp; Materials:_</nbsp>

<p>Plywood sheet-whatever size you want (we used 3/4″ plywood that was 8′ x 14″)<br />
8 L-Brackets<br />
1 package of Screen Door nylon<br />
Wide head tacks or staple gun<br />
1 extra piece of lumber-(4′ 1×4)<br />
Wood screws or nails</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/03/how-to-build-a-planter-box/planter-box-2-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/03/planter-box-21-325x244.jpg" alt="" title="planter-box-2" /></a><em>Directions:</em></p>

<ol>
  <li>Cut four equal (and they really do need to be equal!) lengths of wood (I used some scrap 3/4” plywood that was 8′ x 14”).</li>
  <li>Attach L-brackets to each side, forming a square.</li>
  <li>Cut a sufficient amount of screen material to cover the bottom of the box (I use twice as much and doubled it over).</li>
  <li>Using a staple gun (or tacks with a wide head) fasten the screen material to the bottom of the box, keeping it tight.</li>
  <li>Fold the excess screen material back inward (under the box) and staple it. This serves a two-fold purpose—it gives some strength to the staples (in case the screen rips) and it hides the excess without having to cut it off.</li>
  <li>Cut two equal lengths of a smaller kind of lumber (I used a 4′ 1×4) and miter the ends at a 45º angle, making each look like a trapezoid (viz. not a parallellogram).</li>
  <li>Screw (or nail, if you’re brave) the two 1x4s to the bottom of the box diagonally.</li>
</ol>

<p>That’s it! The quick and dirty way to throw together a planter box for Spring. Of course, you can grab some outdoor stain or sealant if you’d like to further protect the box. We, however, have come to like the gray, weathered look of our first box and thus decided not to treat the wood at all.</p>

<p>I hope this helps. Once again feel free to email us with any questions or clarification needs.</p>

<p>Happy Building!</p>

    <p>Working in a public relations office and running a blog definitely has its perks. This past week I was asked to help bake treats for the re-accreditation committee coming to review our college. My contribution was one of multiple treats and favors made by alumni and faculty. After much deliberation I decided to make pie–not just any pie, mini pies in cute little jars–who could resist?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/03/lemon-berry-pie-jars/lemonberrypie-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/03/lemonberrypie-2-575x403.jpg" alt="lemon berry pie" title="lemonberrypie (2)" /></a></p>

<p>Berry pies are not terribly difficult to bake so I was at a loss for how to spice up my treat. I settled on creative crusts and lots of lemon. For my first trial pie, I used raspberries and lemon zest. The lemon zest alone didn’t give it enough pizzazz so I altered my ingredients and came up with this tasty recipe.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/03/lemon-berry-pie-jars/lemonberrypie-1/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/03/lemonberrypie-1-575x382.jpg" alt="lemon berry pie" title="lemonberrypie (1)" /></a></p>

Directions

1.  Thaw berries and drain in a strainer.
2.  Place berries, lemon juice, sugar, tapioca, zest, cinnamon and vanilla into a large bowl. Gently combine until berries are well coated.
3.  Allow to sit for 20 minutes.
4.  Preheat oven to 400 degrees and prepare the dough.
5.  For the pie crust, combine flour and salt.
6.  Cut in the shortening a small amount at a time. I use a fork for this portion of the process. Scoop out a little shortening at a time and press the clumps into the flour. You want to see the flour turn crumbly.
7.  After all the shortening is combined. Add cold water one tablespoon at a time. Toss dough until it forms an even mixture. This is the point where most instructions will tell you to refrigerate the dough for at least one hour. I have done this with and without refrigeration and honestly couldn\'t tell the difference, so, I leave it up to you.
8.  The last step is filling your container-of-choice and laying the crust over the top. For my jars, I used two different types of flowers cookie cutters and laid the first pattern over the top of the jar. I cut the middles out of each flower with a frosting tip. The second, smaller cookie cut-out I baked separately on a cookie sheet.
9.  Brush your crust with egg wash (1 egg and 2 tbsp water) before placing in the oven and again after 10 minutes. Don\'t forget to also sprinkle the crust with cinnamon and sugar.
10.  Bake for at least 15 minutes (see baking precautions below).
11.  The berries are full of liquid so you need to monitor the pies carefully. I didn\'t want the berries overflowing onto my crust so I let it bake until the juice started bubbling over (about 15 minutes), then removed the pies from the oven to cool for a a few minutes before putting them back in under the broiler to finish browning the crust (about 15 minutes).
12.  I finished my pie packaging by hot gluing fake leaves onto the side of the jars and tying them with twine.

<p>Happy Baking!</p>

    <p>Working on a cut-flower farm is not the idealized job I once thought it to be. No, I used to think cutting flowers all day would be simple, relaxing, and inspiring. Although at times cutting can be all of these things, more often working on the farm can be summed up as painful, dirty, and sweaty. Let me assure you, the cut-flower life is not one to be entered into lightly. Although aspects are very rewarding it is a difficult job–and this from someone who only works on the farm once a week.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/03/springs-sprouts/dsc_0059-001/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/03/DSC_0059-001-575x381.jpg" alt="" title="Farm Sunset" /></a></p>

<p>I spent a few days this week, my spring break, helping Linda out at <a href="www.auntwillieswildflowers.com">Aunt Willies Wildflowers</a>. What do I have to show for my hard work? Sunburns, callouses, 50-or-so cuts and scrapes (and no, I am in <em>no way</em> complaining) and of course a few photos just for you. For me, the hard work and painfully sore nights are worth being outside and enjoying the daily surprises of nature.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/03/springs-sprouts/dsc_0017/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/03/DSC_0017-575x381.jpg" alt="" title="DSC_0017" /></a></p>

<p>In the early months of spring, we (and I mean mostly Roy and Linda) take on a variety of tasks to prepare for the cutting season. These tasks include the following:<br />
-fill seed trays (each holding upwards of 200 seedlings at a time)<br />
-hoe flower beds<br />
-stake down landscape fabric<br />
-transplant seedlings into the hoophouse<br />
-clear dead bushes and plants<br />
-weed for hours on end.<br />
Getting the farm ready for the cutting season is a very dirty job, but of course, someone has to do it.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/03/springs-sprouts/dsc_0022-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/03/DSC_0022-575x381.jpg" alt="" title="DSC_0022" /></a></p>

<p>I took these photos to give you an idea of how barren the farm can seem early in the season and how incredibly fast the plants grow to fill all this empty space (check out last year’s images under <a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/farm-photos/">“Farm Photos”</a> to get an idea). It never ceases to amaze me how many new plants are sprouting each week.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/03/springs-sprouts/dsc_0069-001/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/03/DSC_0069-001-575x381.jpg" alt="" title="Sprouts" /></a></p>

<p>One month from now these empty beds will be full of flowers so hang on to your britches and keep checking back with us because them cuttin’ days are coming.</p>

    <p>Jack and I are always looking for low-calorie, high protein and of course, good tasting snacks to hold us over throughout the busy day. We have been trying out various trail mix varieties over the last few weeks and finally figured out an inexpensive way to make our very own.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/03/granola-trail-mix/homemadegranola/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/03/homemadegranola-325x488.jpg" alt="homemade granola" title="homemadegranola" /></a>Instead of using a nut-based mix, we decided to use granola as the main ingredient and add in mixed nuts, M&amp;Ms, and craisins. We bought a bulk bag of craisins for $3 and a bulk nuts for $4.</p>

<p>As for the granola, all it takes is a few cups of old-fashioned oats.</p>

<p><em>Granola:</em></p>

<p>3 c. old-fashioned oats<br />
3 tbsp. brown sugar<br />
1/4 tsp. salt<br />
1/2 tsp. cinnamon<br />
1/3 c. honey<br />
1/4 c. canola oil<br />
1 tsp. vanilla</p>

<nbsp>  
<nbsp>  
_Directions:_</nbsp></nbsp>

<p>Preheat oven to 300 degrees Fahrenheit. Combine oats, sugar, salt and cinnamon in a large bowl. Combine remaining ingredients in a separate bowl. Pour honey mixture over oats-coat thoroughly. Once the oats are coated, spread onto a cookie sheet, thin and even. Place in oven. Stir the granola at least every 12 minutes to keep it from burning–you really don’t want this to burn. Remove granola from oven after 30 minutes or when oats turn a golden brown. Allow to cool completely. Add mixed nuts, fruit, chocolate, craisins or whatever else you can think of to spice up your trail mix. Here’s where I learned all about <a href="http://www.chow.com/food-news/55265/how-to-make-granola/">granola making</a>.</p>

<p>Adding fruit to your mix can become quite expensive, however you can easily dry your own fruit pieces. Jack is currently drying mangoes to add to our mix–yummy!</p>

<p>I used 1/4 of the bag of craisins and 1/4 the box of nuts with 1 batch of oats to yield about 8 cups of trail mix. Why is this important to note? We can make a few more batches!</p>

<p>You can also skip the trail mix and simply eat the granola for breakfast.</p>

    <p>I am working on some fun new posts for you all but in the meantime I decided to share a few photographs of the moss dish I threw together from the leftover workshop materials.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/03/mini-moss-terrarium/dsc_0013/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/03/DSC_0013-575x381.jpg" alt="" title="Moss #1" /></a></p>

<p>The bowl is from Wal-Mart and only cost $2.50. I used stones, tree bark, privet berries, and a pine cone.I took the pine cone and peeled off a few of the layers, sticking them upright into the middle of the dish to add texture and break up the scene.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/03/mini-moss-terrarium/dsc_0010/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/03/DSC_0010-575x381.jpg" alt="" title="Moss #2" /></a></p>

<p>Remember you can use absolutely anything to make your terrarium–weeds, twigs, succulents, stones, moss, leaves… For taller containers, I would recommend starting with dirt, followed by small pebbles or stones, and finally your greenery to help add lots of textural contrast. See the link below for a good example of this.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/03/mini-moss-terrarium/dsc_0005/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/03/DSC_0005-575x381.jpg" alt="" title="Moss #3" /></a></p>

<p>There are many varieties of terrariums to make…Jack and I have been debating either a Hobbit Hole terrarium or maybe even this <a href="http://www.yellowbrickhome.com/2011/04/19/dino-battle-and-building-a-terrarium/">Dinosaur terrarium</a>, which just happens to be my favorite!</p>

<p>If you decide to brave the terrarium project, be sure to send us a photo! Happy Sunday!</p>

    <p>Tonight I am breathing a huge sigh of relief after making it through another week of midterms. Now I intend to spend my next week (Spring Break) re-cooperating, reading “The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks” and stocking up on some great blog posts for you all.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/03/the-patterns-of-life/dsc_0007/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/03/DSC_0007-575x689.jpg" alt="" title="Living Room Curtains" /></a></p>

<p>For today, I thought I would give you a glimpse of our home through the patterns that inspire it. As many of you know, the apartment life is just not the same a turning an actual house into your very own home. Although Jack and I have a lovely apartment, certain rules keep us from making it truly ours. So, without being able to paint the walls, hang anything heavy, attach molding, etc. patterns have become my way of making due until the eventual day that we are able to purchase a home of our own.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/03/the-patterns-of-life/dsc_0021/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/03/DSC_0021-575x689.jpg" alt="" title="Kitchen Curtains" /></a></p>

<p>These photos are just a few of my favorite patterns that I have in our apartment that I hope to one day incorporate into a home of our own. Keeping these patterns in sight keeps me looking forward to the future and to the possibilities it holds–and I don’t simply mean for decorating.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/03/the-patterns-of-life/dsc_0027/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/03/DSC_0027-575x689.jpg" alt="" title="Giraffe Handbag" /></a></p>

<p>I hope you’ve enjoyed this unique sneak peak into our little apartment living.</p>

<p><strong>D</strong>etails, details, details! I have noticed that in the past few years the detail elements of a wedding day have become increasingly important to brides, wedding planners and photographers. If you look at any wedding style blogs, like <a href="http://www.stylemepretty.com/">Style Me Pretty</a>, <a href="http://www.oncewed.com/">Once Wed</a>, <a href="http://greenweddingshoes.com/">Green Wedding Shoes</a> and countless others, the photography featured revolves around how to implement fantastic detail and intricacy into a wedding or event.</p>

<p><strong>A</strong>s a wedding photographer I realized that I needed to learn quickly how to take the kind of photos that would highlight and pay tribute to the details every bride, florist and wedding coordinator spend countless hours creating.<br />
Of course at the end of the day, the photo of the “first kiss” is more important to my client than the cool photograph of the cupcake tower or bouquets. However, details seam together the story of the day, revealing something about the bride and groom, and hopefully reminding them of the depth of their wedding day.</p>

<p><strong>A</strong>lthough I have certainly not mastered how to take detail shots, I have learned a lot in the past few years and thought I would share some specifics of what I’ve learned here with you. Even if you’re not a photographer these techniques can apply to any detail photo you may want to take. From taking photos of your latest creation in the kitchen, to the flowers blooming in your garden to the next event you attend or host.</p>

<p>1) <strong>Find good light</strong>- The first thing to do is make sure you have great natural light. Seriously, light can make the difference between a mediocre photograph and a photo that makes you sigh! Sometimes this will mean moving the object of your photograph from its original location (if possible) to a location with better light. The photo below is from a wedding I recently shot. I was taking photos of the reception details and took this photo of the tiered cookie stand. The first one was taken in the afternoon (before anyone came into the reception) and I didn’t have time to move it to better light. It is dark and although it works, it is not the best photo. Later in the evening the room was filled with lovely light and I got this photograph of the same detail.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/02/guest-post-photographing-details/detailsblog1/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/02/detailsblog1-575x427.jpg" alt="" title="detailsblog1" /></a></p>

<p>2) <strong>Remove anything distracting</strong>- I learned this tip from <a href="http://www.jasminestarblog.com/">Jasmine Star</a> in her first <a href="http://www.creativelive.com/courses/jasmine_star">creative live workshop</a>. She encouraged photographers to move anything that would “cheapen” the photo. Feel free to move things like salt and pepper, serving utensils and sugar packets from a table. And of course, put them back after you get the photo you need. Before I heard Jasmine talk about this, I was too afraid to touch or move anything on the wedding day. I didn’t want to mess anything up. However, once I had the confidence to remove distracting items from my frame, my photos of flowers and tables settings started looking more like something you could find in a magazine. Holla!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/02/guest-post-photographing-details/detailsblog2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/02/detailsblog2-575x383.jpg" alt="" title="detailsblog2" /></a></p>

<p>3) <strong>Use surrounding environment</strong>- Use your environment to add interest to your photograph. First take a few photos of your object and then take a step back. What else in the room can you use to your advantage? Is there a window that can act as a natural frame for your object? Are there other elements already in the room that you can add to your photograph to make it tell a story? An example of this is in the photos below. I took these photos this summer at <a href="http://www.kiranoblephotographyblog.com/2011/08/the-vue-wedding-jack-shay/">Jackson and Shayla’s wedding</a>. Shayla got ready at her parents beautiful home. I started out the day taking photos of her jewelry, shoes, dress and makeup. I wanted close-up photos of her hair-piece and rings and I started out in a spot I thought had good light, but the background was a little boring. Then I saw the antique books sitting on the coffee table. I moved the rings and hair-piece and immediately the photos took on more life. The books, wood tray and burlap added texture the photograph was missing.</p>

<p>4)<strong> Lower your perspective-</strong>- This one is simple. To diversify your the kind of detail shots you take, simply change up your angle and perspective. At first, I simply shot a table setting by standing above it and shooting down. While this type of perspective can yield good photos, changing your angle or getting “low” can capture the setting and mood in a much stronger way. The photos below are from <a href="http://www.kiranoblephotographyblog.com/2011/09/oregon-city-golf-club-wedding/">Dani and Tyson’s</a>wedding last summer. One was shot from above, the other I shot by getting on my knees and getting “eye level” with the table.</p>

<p>5) <strong>Shoot wide-open</strong>- In my opinion, one of the best ways to get strong detail shots is to shoot with your camera set at a low f-stop. (Click <a href="http://www.homephotog.com/tutorials/aperture.shtml">HERE</a>to read a great explanation about aperture and f-stops.) By shooting “wide-open” you not only get the most out of all the pretty light, your detail will stand out and you’ll achieve that cool “drop-off” effect. Below are a few detail photos that I shot wide open and the settings.</p>

    <p>I’ve realized over the past year that I am much better at capturing the small details of our farm workshops than I am at photographing the people involved. Perhaps it’s because the objects don’t move, or maybe it has to do with their vivid colors. Either way, I thought I would share a few of my favorite photos from last week’s cooking lesson and moss workshop.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/02/setting-the-scene/dsc_0044/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/02/DSC_0044-575x381.jpg" alt="" title="DSC_0044" /></a></p>

<p>These photos capture unique aspects of the atmosphere we try to create out at <a href="http://www.auntwillieswildflowers.com">Aunt Willie’s Wildflowers</a>–quaint, old-fashioned, peaceful–although nature has already done most of the work for us. Whatever words these might bring to mind, I hope they make you take pause and think about the little details in your own life that you may be overlooking every day.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/02/setting-the-scene/dsc_0068/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/02/DSC_0068-575x381.jpg" alt="" title="DSC_0068" /></a></p>

<p>When planning a dinner party, birthday, or wedding, don’t forget the impact little details have on the event and on the way you remember it years later.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/02/setting-the-scene/dsc_0140/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/02/DSC_0140-575x381.jpg" alt="" title="DSC_0140" /></a></p>

<p>Be sure to check back with us soon for an incredible guest post from my friend, Kira, of <a href="http://www.kiranoblephotographyblog.com/">Kira Noble Photography</a>, on how to best photograph the little details.</p>

    <p>This Saturday was our first workshop of the season at <a href="http://www.auntwillieswildflowers.com">Aunt Willies Wildflowers</a>. You may wonder what type of flowers are growing in Tennessee in the middle of February? Well, with the exception of a few flowers that have sprouted in the hoop house and early-bird daffodils, we have lots and lots of moss.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/02/moss-workshop/dsc_0112/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/02/DSC_0112-575x381.jpg" alt="" title="DSC_0112" /></a></p>

<p>Moss is an easily underestimated little plant, however the possibilities are endless. For the workshop we filled frosted glassware with dirt then the ladies took mosses of varied colors and textures to cover the dirt. Finally, the ladies used a variety of twigs, dried plants, pebbles, and willow to make their moss gardens come to life.</p>

<p>This workshop also included a home-cooked meal along with cooking lesson from <a href="http://www.lizbushong.com/index.html">Liz Bushong of Serve it up Sassy!</a> She made a mullet soup, spring green salad with blood orange dressing, and lemon-herb scones.<br />
<a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/02/moss-workshop/dsc_0039/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/02/DSC_0039-325x215.jpg" alt="" title="DSC_0039" /></a></p>

<p>I also made a another batch of lemon white chocolate truffles to share. You can find the recipe <a href="http://kellynbakes.blogspot.com/2010/05/white-chocolate-lemon-truffles.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>Here are my recipe adjustments: I used 1-1/2 c. of white chocolate, and instead of using the double boiler method I combined the zest of 1 lemon with the cream and butter in a saucepan over medium heat until it started bubbling. Then I removed the pan from heat, added the chocolate and mixed until smooth. Next add the extract and transfer to a bowl to cool in the fridge. Follow the rest of the directions at <a href="http://kellynbakes.blogspot.com/2010/05/white-chocolate-lemon-truffles.html">K Bake</a>s accordingly.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/farm-photos/dsc_0162/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/06/DSC_0162-325x489.jpg" alt="" title="Tea Kettle and Pussy Willow" /></a>After completing the moss gardens, the ladies used various willow, forced forsythia and privet berries to make winter arrangements. Even in the winter, with no flowers in bloom, it is still possible to make beautiful arrangements for your home.</p>

<p>The moss workshop/cooking class was a new addition to the farm schedule and a good start to the flower season. I’ve added a few more <em>edited</em> photos of the workshop under our <a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/farm-photos/">“Farm Photos”</a> tab, complete with photos of Linda’s beautiful table setting, moss gardens, and flower arrangements from the hoop house. To see all the <em>rough</em> workshop photos <a href="http://www.dropbox.com/gallery/38095343/1/Moss%20Workshop?h=cd2b86">click here</a>.</p>

<p>Make your own wooded arrangement or moss garden this week–you might be surprised to find that everything you need is right outside your front door.</p>

    <p>Just a few lemon chocolate truffles to share with you for Valentine’s day.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/02/lemon-chocolate-truffles-v-day-cards/dsc_0114/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/02/DSC_0114-575x392.jpg" alt="" title="DSC_0114" /></a></p>

<p>You can find the recipe at <a href="http://www.swapnascuisine.com/2011/10/lemon-truffles.html">Swapna’s Cuisine</a>. First, I made her version using white chocolate…</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/02/lemon-chocolate-truffles-v-day-cards/dsc_0008-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/02/DSC_00081-575x387.jpg" alt="" title="DSC_0008" /></a></p>

<p>Then I made them with milk chocolate. This version has a flavor combination similar to the orange -chocolate eggs, surprisingly delicious.</p>

<p>The envelope was for Jack’s card. I simply wrapped red string around it until I approved of the pattern.</p>

<p>I’ve decided to jump on board with the thousands of bloggers sharing their “Week of Pinterest” ideas. It seems silly not to considering most of my blogging ideas are inspired by pins. If you haven’t had a chance to join the pinning movement, I highly suggest you jump on the bandwagon and start enjoying hours of pinned inspiration.</p>

<p>Be forewarned, Pinterest is highly addictive. Check out our boards by clicking the “P” in the right column.</p>

<p>This week’s pinning delights include the following:</p>

<p>1.) Table Arrangement from <a href="http://www.thefoundblog.com/home/category/weddings?currentPage=3">The Found Blog</a><br />
2.) Blackberry Red Wine Chocolate Cake from <a href="http://www.thekitchn.com/blackberry-red-wine-chocolate-cake-love-olive-oil-165276">the kitchn</a><br />
3.) Linen closet organization from <a href="http://www.marthastewart.com/274903/25-closet-storage-and-office-organizers/@center/276989/organizing#slide_17">Martha Stewart</a><br />

    <p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/02/decorating-one-step-at-a-time/dsc_0083-nef/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/02/DSC_0083.NEF_-325x488.jpg" alt="" title="DSC_0083.NEF" /></a>I realized recently that I hadn’t been posting anything remotely crafty, just food. Perhaps that gives you a glimpse into my study habits–attempt to study, get distracted by baking, then munch on the sugary goodness all night long.</p>

<p>I have been working on this painting for a few weeks now and finally decided to see what it looked like in our bedroom. I am still tweaking the background but can’t seem to find time to officially finish, so up on the wall it went and I’m so glad!</p>

<p>Decorating our bedroom has been a painstakingly slow process. I saw a picture when we first got married of a simple color scheme, white, tan, and navy blue–the room was exquisite. Since seeing this image I have been trying to capture that same feeling in our room and haven’t quite been able to get there with our limited time and funds. However, I thought I would share a few photos so you can see some examples of turning cheap, random items into coordinated decor. We still have a ways to go but these little touches are satisfying enough for now.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/02/decorating-one-step-at-a-time/dsc_0074-nef-3/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/02/DSC_0074.NEF_2-325x259.jpg" alt="" title="DSC_0074.NEF" /></a><br />
I decided to hang the painting above our bed because it provides a good central focus and ties in more of the warm neutrals in the room. As with most of my paintings, I found an image online that I liked and attempted my best replication.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/02/decorating-one-step-at-a-time/dsc_0077-nef/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/02/DSC_0077.NEF_-325x201.jpg" alt="" title="DSC_0077.NEF" /></a></p>

<p>The pillows on the bed are probably my favorite part (see <a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/09/10-minute-pillowcase-tutorial/">pillow tutorial here</a>). I have been slowly collecting fabrics in a variety of patterns and shades of blue to keep adding to the mix. I want the pillows to look eclectic and be the main pop of color in the room. I currently have 3 more fabrics waiting for me to turn into pillowcases.</p>

<p>We have also started collecting blue glass jars mainly because I love the way the light shines through them when streaming in the back window. The trick here is to have a small collection of jars that doesn’t look cluttered.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/02/decorating-one-step-at-a-time/dsc_0087-nef/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/02/DSC_0087.NEF_-325x216.jpg" alt="" title="DSC_0087.NEF" /></a></p>
<nbsp>  
I have made great strides in the past four years of marriage in learning to just let go. I used to have so many little collections because of my attempts to be thrifty. You never know which items can be reused or refurbished? And the items I don’t think I’ll ever use, I can usually attribute some sentimental emotion to in order to justify its continued safekeeping in our home.</nbsp>

<p>However, one day you just reach a point where you must throw out everything that even partially resembles clutter and voila! A clean and clutter free home. Now the trick is maintaining that environment. All that to say, this is my one collection at the moment–blue jars.</p>

<p>Well, that’s just a few of the decorating elements in our room. The wall adjacent to the bed also has a large hanging tapestry that matches the center pillow. We aren’t allowed to paint so hanging fabric on the walls has been our substitute for color additions.</p>

<p>Hope you’ve enjoyed this small glimpse into our developing home.</p>

What better way to celebrate this milestone than with a moist lemon cake and meringue-ish frosting? Hooray!</p>

<p>When I realized last week that I had just published post #99, I couldn’t decide what project was worthy of #100. So I finally decided to allow my hectic schedule to dictate the project depth, and thus my free time this week allotted enough time to bake a single cake.</p>

<p>I chose to bake a lemon cake for two reasons:<br />
1.) I had leftover Meyer Lemons from an impulse buy (they were so pretty).<br />
2.) I had never attempted a plain lemon cake.</p>

<p>Plain lemon cake may not seem like much in the way of motivation, however, as an ex-hater of all things lemon, I now feel the need to devour as much citrus-flavored goodness as humanly possible. So, that’s the story of how I came to bake a lemon cake.</p>

<p>While scouring the internet for lemony treats, I decided to abide by three rules for choosing the recipe:<br />
1.) Simple<br />
2.) Legitimate source<br />
3.) Already purchased ingredients</p>

<p>As typically happens, my friend Martha Stewart came to my rescue. Martha’s <a href="http://www.marthastewart.com/632498/lemon-cake">lemon cake</a> is a slight variation of her vanilla cake, which was perfect considering, I love her vanilla cake. Really, you can’t go wrong. She also used a <a href="http://www.marthastewart.com/341535/whipped-frosting">whipped frosting</a> on top which looks meringue-like but is actually lighter, almost foamy.</p>

<p>This lemon cake was incredibly moist with just the right amount of lemony goodness. So, if you’re looking for a simple, fail-safe, and super-moist cake recipe, Martha’s Lemon Cake is the way to go.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/01/100-posts-lemon-cake/lemon-cake-slice/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/01/lemon-cake-slice-575x382.jpg" alt="" title="Lemon Cake Slice" /></a>And so, here we are–100 posts down and hopefully many more to come. Thank you to all my diligent readers who hang in there with me through the good, the bad, and the ugly posts.</p>

<p>On another miletsone note, we are quickly coming up on the one year anniversary of The Kitchen Curtains and I would love to hear from you. Please shoot me an email or leave a comment letting us know what your favorite post has been so far.</p>

<p>Happy 100!</p>

    <p>You remember how I made all those healthy freezer meals for the hubby and I to enjoy this semester? Well, if you’ve learned anything about me from reading this blog, it is most likely the fact that I love sweets. Yes, I admit I have a bit of a sweet tooth. And when I say “a bit” I really mean, “I would probably die without sweets.” Dramatic? Perhaps. However, I’m pretty sure my husband (who has to make midnight Sonic runs) would agree that the above statement is indeed accurate.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/01/no-bake-bites/january-2012-006-nef/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/01/January-2012-006.NEF_-325x216.jpg" alt="" title="No-Bake Bites" /></a></p>

<p>Where am I going with all this? While preparing an abundance of healthy and appropriately portioned meals, I reached a point where I couldn’t stand to look at one more vegetable, and then, I caved.</p>

<p>Here’s my philosophy (also known as justification): healthy eating deserves unhealthy rewards (sound familiar). Where’s the fun/motivation in eating well if you can’t treat yourself to something bad from time to time?</p>

<p>With that in mind, I set to work whipping up these easy and surprisingly, not too unhealthy, No Bake Bites.</p>

<p>I’m sure most of you have made these tasty treats once or twice. I used this <a href="http://www.skinnytaste.com/2011/11/skinny-no-bake-cookies.html#more">No-Bake Cookie recipe from Skinny Taste</a> (a great website for low fat, family-friendly recipes). I liked Gina’s version better than my no-bake recipe mainly because they stick together well for rolling into balls, thus making it easier to have a consistent size, and thus a consistent measurement of calories per cookie bite. According to her blog, 1 serving=2 cookies for a total of 105 calories.</p>

<p>Once the cookies were cooled and covered in powdered sugar, I split them equally into four bags, froze three, and put one in the fridge for us to enjoy after meals. Once we start getting low, I simply pull out another bag to thaw so we never find ourselves wishing for chocolate and settling on something five times worse for us to eat.</p>

<p>Oh and one more thing, these are delicious! Trust me, they’ll satisfy that late night sweet craving. Enjoy!</p>

<p>Aren’t they beautiful? Yes, I realize it is only January and many of you are knee deep in water (I’m talking to my friends and family on the West Coast), but with any luck all those showers will bring pretty flowers!</p>

<p>I decided it was appropriate to talk about flowers this week after receiving an unexpected email. <em>The</em> email. The one that comes every spring from Linda at <a href="http://auntwillieswildflowers.com/">Aunt Willie’s Wildflowers</a> saying it’s time to talk about this year’s workshop schedule. Hooray!</p>

<p>In celebration of the upcoming flower season, and simply because I’m SO excited, I thought I would share a few links with you all.</p>

<p>First off, Linda made her monthly appearance on <a href="http://www2.daytimetricities.com/lifestyles/2012/jan/17/1/planning-your-flowers-for-a-2012-wedding-46271-vi-33913/">Daytime Tricities</a> to show off a few arrangements and advertise for spring weddings.</p>

<p>The second link I have for you is to <a href="http://auntwillies.wordpress.com/">Linda’s blog</a>. That’s right, she started a blog! Now you can see even more farm pictures. Her latest post shows a moss crystal basket arrangement.</p>

<p>I am also giving you the link to the <a href="http://www.kiranoblephotographyblog.com/2012/01/the-small-things/">latest post from Kira Noble Photography</a>. Kira gives readers some great tips for photographing the small things/little details…I think flowers count as small things so this post might be beneficial for the budding florists/photographers among us.</p>

<p>And one more link with pretty flower arrangements from <a href="http://www.flirtyfleurs.com/eye-candy-from-florali/">Flirty Fleurs</a>.</p>

<p>I hope this post has sparked your imagination and served to prepare you just a bit for the exiting season ahead.</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/01/crockpot-chili-recipe/2011-snow-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/01/2011-Snow-2-325x199.jpg" alt="" title="Snow" /></a>Woke up this morning, my third day back in class, to a wonderful text message alerting me of our snow delay! Looking outside it was hard to not mock our little corner of Tennessee for their never-fail overreactions to winter weather (less than 1 in. this morning). However, I got to go back to sleep for 45 minutes before my long day, so no complaining here. I’ve been hanging onto this chili recipe, waiting for that perfectly brisk and chilling day to share it with you. I think you’ll agree after seeing this picture that today’s the day!</p>

<p>This savory chili is sure to warm both your heart and tummy on days like these when you just can’t seem to escape the winter chill. Simply throw the ingredients together at night or in the morning, and leave the crock pot on low throughout the day–allowing your humble abode to fill with the welcoming aromas of coffee, chocolate, and spices.</p>

<p><strong><em>Crockpot Chili</em></strong></p>

<p>3 cups pinto beans (or 2-3 cans if not using dry)<br />
2 cans kidney beans<br />
1 lb ground beef<br />
8 oz can of tomato sauce<br />
1 tsp cocoa<br />
1/2 tsp cinnamon<br />
2 tsp garlic powder<br />
1 tsp parsley<br />
1 tbsp Worcestershire<br />
Easy BBQ Sauce (see recipe below)<br />
1 sweet onion (chopped)<br />
5 carrots (shredded and chopped)<br />
2 Roma tomatoes (chopped)</p>

<p><strong>_Easy BBQ Sauce<br />
_</strong></p>

<p>1 cup ketchup<br />
1/2 cup red wine vinegar<br />
1/2 cup brown sugar<br />
2 tablespoons soy sauce<br />
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce<br />
2 tablespoons spicy brown mustard<br />
1 teaspoon ground ginger<br />
1 teaspoon garlic powder<br />
1 tablespoon olive oil</p>

<p><em>Directions:</em><br />
If you are using dry pinto beans, soak overnight and prepare beans per instructions on the bag.</p>

<p>Place 1 lb of thawed ground beef in your slow cooker. Season with cinnamon, garlic, parsley and anything else that floats your boat. I threw in a pack of Goya seasoning. It is fantastic and can be found in the Hispanic food section of the grocery store, it is in an orange and white box.</p>

<p>Separate the meat a bit and allow to brown slightly. Add beans, tomato sauce, Worcestershire, and cocoa. Prepare the Easy BBQ Sauce by simply combining the ingredients above on the stove then pour into the crock pot. I changed a few ingredients to work with what we had in the fridge, but the <a href="http://www.recipetips.com/recipe-cards/t--2516/easy-barbecue-sauce.asp">here</a> is the original.</p>

<p>Shred the carrots first, then chop. Chop the onion and tomatoes. Add vegetables to crock pot. Stir well and let sit until you are ready to eat. If you are preparing this a couple hours before eating, set the crock pot on high, if you are planning to leave it on all day, set the crock pot on low. Remember, as with most crock pot dishes, the longer it cooks the tastier it becomes. This is also the recipe I used to prepare our semester of <a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/01/how-to-prepare-freezer-meals/">freezer meals</a>.</p>

<p>Hope this warms you up on the cold days to come. Welcome to Winter!</p>

    <p>Our kitchen has seen much progress in the past 4 years as Jack and I develop new ways of cooking that keep us healthy, provide warm homemade meals, and save time. This past year we started following some of the Biggest Loser protein menu guidelines to help define our eating styles. We both attend classes and run back and forth between 2 other jobs–this means our eating time is limited and usually involves us scarfing down whatever is quick and easy. Not to mention the hassle of coming home and attempting to prepare dinner. By the time 6 o’clock rolls around, the last thing we want to do is thaw and prep food. The Biggest Loser protein packed menus are fabulous (<a href="http://www.prevention.com/biggest-loser-biggest-loser-meal-plan-0">sample menu</a>), because as the name suggests, they are packed with protein. What does that mean for us? We can eat less throughout the day and still remain full and energized enough to exercise those valuable brain cells. <a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/01/how-to-prepare-freezer-meals/dsc_0037-nef/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/01/DSC_0037.NEF_-325x205.jpg" alt="" title="DSC_0037.NEF" /></a></p>

<p><strong>What does our daily food system usually consist of?</strong></p>

<p><em>Breakfast:</em> 1 slice whole grain toast, 2 poached egg whites, 8 oz fat-free milk, coffee, fruit (you can even have 2 sausage links in this meal plan)</p>

<p><em>Snack:</em> 1 medium apple, sliced, with 1 tablespoon peanut butter or 1 non-fat yogurt cup, 1 nature oats granola bar</p>

<p>_Lunch:_Black Bean Burrito with salsa, onions, tomatoes, romaine lettuce, and 1 wheat tortilla or 2 cups chopped romaine lettuce, tomato, cucumber and 4 oz lemon-pepper seasoned chicken (cooked ahead of time and separated into baggies to freeze)</p>

<p><em>Dinner:</em> This is where we added in a bit of variety. Usually we pair fish with either 1 cup of brown rice, a side salad, or 1 serving of penne pasta with vegetables.</p>

<p>However, with school in full swing I pre-made 37 freezer meals for two in order to help us stay healthy, eat smaller portions and still have time for the necessary nightly study extravaganza. <a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/01/how-to-prepare-freezer-meals/dsc_0044-nef/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/01/DSC_0044.NEF_-575x426.jpg" alt="" title="Freezer Meals" /></a></p>

<p>The meals I included are made from fresh ingredients and are separated into moderate serving sizes. Most of these meals are to be paired with either brown rice or a side salad for a healthy and filling meal.</p>

<p><strong>Spring Semester Freezer Meals:</strong></p>

<p><em>Roasted Red Pepper and Tomato-Basil Soup</em><br />
Yields: 8 cups<br />
Serving Size: 1 cup<br />
2-Person Meals: 4<br />
Pair with: salad or homemade wheat bread</p>

<p><em>BBQ Chili</em><br />
Yields: 10 cups<br />
Serving Size: 1/2 cup<br />
2-Person Meals: 10<br />
Pair with: 1/2 cup brown rice or homemade wheat bread</p>

<p><em>Vegetable Pork Roast</em><br />
Yields: 10 cups<br />
Serving Size: 1 cup<br />
2-Person Meals: 5<br />
Pair with: 1/2 cup brown rice or side salad</p>

<p><em>Steamed Vegetables</em><br />
Yields: 18 cups<br />
Serving Size: 1 cup<br />
2-Person Meals: 9<br />
Pair with: 1 cup brown rice or 1 cup penne pasta<br />
Note: We eat vegetables with everything so you can throw these into the steamer basket while your rice cooks or toss them into a pasta dish or simple cook as a side to go with your fish.</p>

<p><em>Rump Roast</em><br />
Yields: 44 oz<br />
Serving Size: 4 oz<br />
2-Person Meals: 11<br />
Pair with: sandwiches, salads, tacos, soups, pasta, etc<br />
Note: I cooked an extra roast and shred the meat just to have extra meat on hand for whatever other dish we may want to throw together. I didn’t do anything special to this meat so there could be a variety of uses.</p>

<p><em>Pinto Beans</em><br />
Note: I cooked 1 whole bag of dry pinto beans, using 3 cups for the chili, 2 cups to make hummus (great low-calorie snack), and 2 cups of leftover to use as a side or to throw into a stew. The bag only cost $1.49 and the resulting meals make the extra cook time worthwhile.</p>

<p>I was able to buy all of the ingredients for these freezer meals including a large bag of brown rice and salad fixings to go along with the meals for under $100. The only part that wasn’t included was the rump roast and 1 lb of ground beef because we bought grass-fed beef last summer from the Doan’s farm.</p>

<p><strong>Freezer Meals Tips:</strong></p>

<p>1.) When dividing your portions into baggies, think about how much unthawing/rethawing you want to do. I don’t put more than 4 individual portions into each bag, i.e. 2 nights of meals for 2 people.</p>

<p>2.) Flatten bags of food onto cookie sheets to freeze. Once frozen remove from sheet and stack upright to conserve freezer space.</p>

<p>3.) Many people will tell you not to cook your meat ahead of time for beef/pork crockpot meals as you will lose some of the flavor. I have frozen crockpot meals both ways, and I didn’t think it made that much of a difference so if I have time to cook it all ahead of time I will. Chicken, however, you really should cook ahead of time if mixing with other foods.</p>

<p>4.) As always, be creative. You might be amazed to find that most of your meals can be prepped ahead of time and set out to thaw or thrown into a crockpot to cook or even just thaw all day. And let’s face it, who doesn’t like coming home after a crappy day to a house that smells like Grandma’s old-fashioned pot roast? Brings a smile to my face just thinking about it.</p>

<p>5.) Keep your freezer organized. I’m a stickler for organization. I love thinking of ways to organize and the process of organizing my life. For instance, my favorite part about January is buying a new planner for the year–so refreshing! I grabbed an old filing bin to store our randomly packaged meats. It also works well for “filing” flattened soup ziplocks. You can find little bins of all sizes to fit your freezer at the dollar tree so don’t let a few dollars discourage you from years of organized freezer bliss.</p>

<p>I hope you’ve enjoyed these few ideas and tips. I will be posting my freezer meal recipes throughout the next few posts. If you have any questions, suggestions, or tips to share please send them my way.</p>

<p>Happy freezing!</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/01/christmas-party-a-few-tips/christmas2011-215/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/01/Christmas2011-215-e1325875811866-325x489.jpg" alt="" title="Christmas2011-215" /></a> What holiday homecoming is complete without dressing up at least once for a Christmas party? Many individuals are put off by throwing their own party because, let’s face it, organizing an event on top of work and family can at times seem daunting. As soon as Jack and I knew we would be flying home for Christmas this year, I begged my mom to let me throw a little shindig at their house. These are a few of the set-up pictures.</p>

<p>When planning a holiday get-together, be sure to choose quick, easy and inexpensive treats that can feed a large group. In keeping with this rule, I decided to make bruschetta. This dish requires tomatoes, cucumber, onion, and feta–all fairly inexpensive and best of all, a little goes a long way. Jack even made baguettes to go along with the bruschetta and save a little money. My parents also decided to buy one HoneyBaked Ham to avoid the hassle of baking all day, and lots of wine.<a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/01/christmas-party-a-few-tips/christmas2011-290-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/01/Christmas2011-2901-325x215.jpg" alt="" title="Baguette Bread" /></a></p>

<p>Another way to lower the stress and remain in budget is to simply ask your friends and family to bring something to share. Many people think they are required to provide everything for the party but most guests are more than happy to contribute and don’t even need to be asked. Remember, it is OK to let go of some of the party-planning responsibility…a tip I find myself repeating often.</p>

<p>Simple is better. Cheese, crackers, wine–even three themed ingredients can make a successful party. We had a wine and cheese bar at the party. My aunt and uncle contributed an out-of this-world homemade tomato jam (recipe to come), that we paired with crackers and various cheeses. I filled up on this combination alone. <a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/01/christmas-party-a-few-tips/christmas2011-283/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/01/Christmas2011-283-325x217.jpg" alt="" title="Wine and Cheese" /></a><br />
A few of the contributed foods included: pumpkin dip and gingersnaps (courtesy of my sister), meatballs (mother-in-law), more cheese and cracker plates (you can never have too many), ham, pickle, and cream cheese rolls (sister-in-law), and more wine.</p>

<p>For the non-wine drinkers, we also created a fun little space for a hot chocolate bar. I emptied cocoa and marshmallows into tins from home depot, and filled a teapot with hot water right before the guests arrived. I also filled clear containers with cinnamon sticks for stirring, and pirouettes to pair with their drinks. We set out the mugs ahead of time for easy access and also decorated the cocoa bar with various desserts, Costco truffles on shiny flower cut outs and blackberry pie. <a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/01/christmas-party-a-few-tips/christmas2011-277/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/01/Christmas2011-277-575x208.jpg" alt="" title="Hot Chocolate Bar" /></a></p>

<p>To decorate, we simply used ornaments and candles to add ambiance and sparkle to the decor. Once again, simple and inexpensive is the key to throwing your own party. <a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/01/christmas-party-a-few-tips/christmas2011-604/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2012/01/Christmas2011-604-325x434.jpg" alt="" title="Kendra and Grammy" /></a>This should be an enjoyable process, not one that will cause stress. Decide ahead of time your budget, time requirements, and how many people you are willing to host. If you aren’t sure, start small and in time, throwing a party will be as easy as 1-2-3.</p>

<p>Remember it’s not about the party, it’s about the people–Coming together with those you love. I hope you’ve enjoyed the pictures from our little holiday party and I hope your holiday gatherings were as joyful and refreshing as ours was. Happy New Year!</p>

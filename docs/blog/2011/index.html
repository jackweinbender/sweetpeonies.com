    <p>Merry Christmas from the West Coast! Jack and I arrived safely this weekend and have been keeping ourselves busy visiting the family and soaking in the fresh smell of Oregon air.</p>

<div id="attachment_2956" style="width: 335px" class="wp-caption alignright">[![](jekyll_uploads/2011/12/chaispicetea-325x487.jpg "chaispicetea")](http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/12/spiced-orange-chai-concentrate/chaispicetea/)

<p>While preparing for all the Christmas get-togethers, I realized I previously promised you all a recipe for Spiced Orange Chai Concentrate. I think I may have even teased you with a comment about how wonderful it tastes but never actually gave you the recipe–so rude. Anyways, this recipe is great for your Christmas get-togethers and as a bonus, it makes your house smell delicious enough to eat.</p>

<div class="hrecipe"><span class="item">

Orange Chai Concentrate

</span>

Prep Time: <span class="preptime">5 minutes<span class="value-title" title="PT5M"></span></span>

Cook Time: <span class="cooktime">30 minutes<span class="value-title" title="PT30M"></span></span>

Total Time: <span class="duration">35 minutes<span class="value-title" title="PT35M"></span></span>

Ingredients

*   <span id="recipeseo-ingredient-0-amount" class="amount">10 Bags</span> <span id="recipeseo-ingredient-0-name" class="name">Black Tea</span>
*   <span id="recipeseo-ingredient-1-amount" class="amount">1 Packet</span> <span id="recipeseo-ingredient-1-name" class="name">Mulling Spices</span>
*   <span id="recipeseo-ingredient-2-amount" class="amount">1 tsp</span> <span id="recipeseo-ingredient-2-name" class="name">Cinnamon</span>
*   <span id="recipeseo-ingredient-3-amount" class="amount">1/2</span> <span id="recipeseo-ingredient-3-name" class="name">Orange</span>
*   <span id="recipeseo-ingredient-4-amount" class="amount">1/2 c.</span> <span id="recipeseo-ingredient-4-name" class="name">Brown Sugar</span>
*   <span id="recipeseo-ingredient-5-amount" class="amount">1 Tbsp</span> <span id="recipeseo-ingredient-5-name" class="name">Honey</span>
*   <span id="recipeseo-ingredient-6-amount" class="amount">1 Tbsp</span> <span id="recipeseo-ingredient-6-name" class="name">Vanilla extract</span>

Directions

1.  Pour 4-1/2 cups of water into a pot and bring to a boil. Make sure to use a pot with a tight-fitting lid. Add the tea bags, mulling spices, cinnamon and orange slices to the pot. Once the mixture is boiling, turn off the stove, apply the lid and allow the concentrate to steep for 20 minutes.
2.  Once the 20 minutes is over, pour the mixture through a fine mesh strainer (we used a reusable coffee filter to strain). Strain a second time if needed.
3.  Pour concentrate back into the pot and stir in the brown sugar, vanilla and honey.

</div>

<p>To enjoy your concentrate, simply mix equal parts milk to concentrate. You can serve this over ice or with warmed milk.</p>

<p>We made jars of this for Christmas gifts this year. This can be a really easy and cute idea. Simply fill a mason jar with concentrate, apply the thin plate of the lid, cover with a scrap of Christmas fabric, then screw the outer part of the lid over the fabric. Tada! Easy wrapping for orange chai Christmas gifts.</p>

<p>Here’s the link to the original <a href="http://www.foodiewithfamily.com/2011/11/03/spiced-orange-chai-concentrate/">Spiced Orange Chai Concentrate</a> recipe. The main difference is they used individual spices instead of one mulling packet. I chose the packet simply because it’s cheaper. They also used a ginger root, which I’m sure tastes great but in case you don’t have one on hand, doing without tastes just as wonderful.</p>

<p>Happy steeping!</p>

    <p>When I first started working out at Aunt Willie’s Wildflowers, I assumed that the end of summer meant the end of workshops and pretty arrangements, luckily, I was mistaken. As if the pumpkin workshop wasn’t cool enough, come December, Linda holds a Christmas centerpiece workshop. The Christmas centerpieces are always beautiful with a variety of styles.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/12/christmas-at-the-farm/centerpieces-039-1/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/12/centerpieces-039-1-575x381.jpg" alt="" title="centerpieces 039-1" /></a></p>

<p>The centerpiece above is my attempt this year. I really like the touches of gold throughout it. Since we are heading home in 2 days (yay!), I decided not to waste my centerpiece on our empty home and gifted it to one of my favorite professors. I know, what a suck-up.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/12/christmas-at-the-farm/centerpieces-040-1/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/12/centerpieces-040-1-325x489.jpg" alt="" title="centerpieces 040-1" /></a>These centerpieces are very simple to make, all you need is a tray, a block of oasis, and lots of greenery. We soaked the oasis in water, cut it to fit the trays (if necessary), and started assembling.</p>

<p>Here are a few of the basics to assembling an oasis centerpiece:</p>

<p>Choose one type of greenery for your first row, my first one was pine, insert ends into the oasis at an angle. You want to cut all your greenery (for all three rows) 8-10 inches long, and space 1-2 inches apart. Row #2 will be up 1-2 inches and will align with the spaces so you won’t have gaps.</p>

<p>Depending on how full your branches are, each row should use about 12 branches total (that’s 4 on each side and 2 on the ends if your centerpiece is the size of a whole block of oasis).</p>

<p>Pick a different greenery for your second layer, I used cedar, and start going around the oasis 1-2 inches up from the first row. Follow the same principles as the first. Pick a third greenery for your top row (this is the top of your sides, not the top of your oasis).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/12/christmas-at-the-farm/centerpieces-036-1-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/12/centerpieces-036-11-325x305.jpg" alt="" title="centerpieces 036-1" /></a></p>

<p>Once the sides are covered, choose a more decorative greenery to start covering the top of your oasis, angling the outer branch slightly upward. I used brown tipped cedar, try to use a more decorative type of branch because this layer will be more visible.</p>

<p>Use any other greenery/shrub/leaf to fill in the top and any holes you may have. I like to go back and place a few magnolia leaves in various places throughout the layers–the shine make the centerpiece look fancy and helps the textures stand out. This is also when I went back through and added bits of yellow.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/12/christmas-at-the-farm/centerpieces-011-1/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/12/centerpieces-011-1-325x308.jpg" alt="" title="centerpieces 011-1" /></a></p>

<p>Now it’s time to add other decorative elements to the top of your centerpiece–dried fruit slices, whole apples, hydrangea, nuts, pine cones, candles. You can use pins, mini-stakes, or hot glue to hold everything in place. I used holly branches, a few slices of dried limes, and Queen Anne’s Lace.</p>

<p>Remember to branch out and stretch your creative capacities. The decorating options with these centerpieces are limitless so take your time and enjoy showing off the final product to friends and family throughout the holiday season.</p>

    <p>We have officially reached December and I am SO extremely excited. Really, I can’t put into words how great it feels to finally be in December. Why does December mean so much to me this year? I get to go home! It feels so great to finally write those words. It has been 2 years since Jack and I have made it home to Oregon. It seems silly but I am so excited just to see my hometown and drive the same old streets.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/12/oregonlove/rice-salad-and-oregon-016/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/12/rice-salad-and-Oregon-016-325x215.jpg" alt="" title="Oregon 2" /></a></p>

<p>In the past two years I have missed 5 weddings, 4 births, many graduations, and 3 funerals–so you can see why I am so anxious to be home and love on all our friends and family who have been through so much.</p>

<p>We love our life here in Tennessee &amp; our wonderful friends, but it’s true what they say, “there’s no place like home”–and I’m going there for 2 weeks!</p>

<nbsp>  
<nbsp>  
Because I can barely contain my excitement about Oregon, I decided to finally put my old Oregon map to use.</nbsp></nbsp>

<p><em>Tools:</em></p>

<p>2 canvases<br />
1 map<br />
4 antiquing chalks (burnt red, brown, gold, orange)<br />
1 glue stick</p>

<p><em>Instructions:</em></p>

<p>Cut map in half, or appropriate size to fit your canvases. Apply a liberal amount of glue to each canvas and carefully apply the map. Gently fold the map around the canvas corners. Use dark brown and burnt red chalk to dust the canvas edges. Brush gold and orange chalks gently over the surface of the map in various areas until you have achieved the desired affect.</p>

<p>I also used red thread to stitch a little heart around our hometown. Such a fun way to celebrate your roots!</p>

    <p>Happy Thanksgiving everyone! I hope right about now your tummies are full and you are enjoying friends and family. For our Thanksgiving, Linda invited us out to the farm to celebrate with her family. I was asked to contribute a dessert–one dessert…too many options.</p>

<p>In an attempt to branch out from my typical holiday dessert contribution, rum cake, I decided to try making a spice cake of sorts to take to the farm. I already had a box of Duncan Hines lemon cake mix, and in an attempt to not waste, I decided to add spices to the pre-made mix and see what happened. Although the finished appearance was less-than-wonderful, the cake tasted absolutely delicious and super moist!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/11/molasses-spice-cake-maple-syrup-frosting/cupcakes-scarf-spice-cake-158/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/11/Cupcakes-scarf-spice-cake-158-575x335.jpg" alt="" title="Cupcakes, scarf, spice cake 158" /></a></p>

<p><em>Spice Cake Ingredients:</em></p>

<p>1 box of lemon cake mix (Duncan Hines)<br />
1/2 c. molasses<br />
1 1/3 c. water<br />
1/4 c. oil<br />
3 eggs<br />
2 tsp. ginger<br />
1 tsp. cinnamon<br />
1/2 tsp. nutmeg</p>

<p>The maple syrup frosting is courtesy of <a href="http://www.countryliving.com/recipefinder/maple-sugar-frosting-3952">Country Living</a>.</p>

<p><em>Maple Syrup Frosting:</em></p>

<p>2 1/4 c. confectioners’ sugar<br />
1/2 c. brown sugar<br />
8 tbsp. (1 stick) butter<br />
1/8 tsp. salt<br />
1/2 c. maple syrup<br />
1 tsp. vanilla<br />
2 tbsp. whole milk</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/11/molasses-spice-cake-maple-syrup-frosting/cupcakes-scarf-spice-cake-166-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/11/Cupcakes-scarf-spice-cake-1661-325x213.jpg" alt="" title="Cupcakes, scarf, spice cake 166" /></a></p>

<p><em>Instructions:</em></p>

<p>Preheat oven to 350 degrees. In a large bowl, combine cake mix, water and oil. Add molasses and eggs. Beat on medium speed for 2 minutes. Add spices.</p>

<p>Grease two circular cake pans with shortening. Divide batter between pans. Bake for 25-30 minutes, until toothpick comes out clean. Allow cakes to cool completely before removing from pans.</p>

<p>While cakes are cooling, prepare the frosting by mixing the sugars, butter and salt on medium speed. Continue beating and add the maple syrup in a slow stream. Add the vanilla and continue to beat until light and fluffy, add milk as needed.</p>

<p>P.S. If you haven’t guessed by now, I’m extremely thankful to have my own kitchen in which I can bake whenever and whatever I want to.</p>

<p>Happy Thanksgiving!</p>

    <p>Can I tell you a sad story? I haven’t baked in a month. True story. On Thursday, I was working on homework and I my oven called to me…or maybe it was my sweet tooth. Either way, it was time to bake. Our weather has been incredibly cold this week, I’m thinking winter is definitely here. So what better way to celebrate than with hot chocolate cupcakes and cinnamon frosting!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/11/hot-chocolate-cupcakes-cinnamon-frosting/dsc_0050/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/11/DSC_0050-575x323.jpg" alt="" title="DSC_0050" /></a></p>

<p>I saw a facebook status that someone had made hot chocolate cupcakes so I set scoured the internet in search of a recipe.</p>

<p>Here are two that I thought looked most appealing:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.rd.com/food/mexican-hot-chocolate-cupcakes-with-cinnamon-butter-cream-frosting/">Mexican Hot Chocolate Cupcakes</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Hot-Chocolate-Cupcakes/">Hot Chocolate Cupcakes</a></p>

<p>I didn’t have any unsweetened baking cocoa in the house and saw other recipes where they used an actual cup of hot chocolate so I figured, why not give it a shot?</p>

<p>The frosting is basically the same as the one for my <a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/02/rummy-shortbread-cookies/">Rummy Shortbread Cookies</a> except, no rum and I added 2 tsp. of cinnamon.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/11/hot-chocolate-cupcakes-cinnamon-frosting/dsc_0028/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/11/DSC_0028-575x260.jpg" alt="" title="DSC_0028" /></a></p>

<p><em>Hot Chocolate Cupcakes:</em></p>

<p>2 cups all-purpose flour<br />
1-1/4 tsp. baking soda<br />
1 tsp. salt<br />
1/4 tsp. baking powder<br />
1 cup hot water<br />
2/3 cup Godiva hot chocolate<br />
3/4 cup shortening<br />
1-1/2 cups sugar<br />
2 eggs<br />
1 tsp. vanilla</p>

<p><em>Instructions:</em></p>

<p>First, heat your oven to 350 degrees. If you have a silicone cupcake tray like me, lightly butter your tray. If you have a metal tray, line the muffin cups with paper liners.</p>

<p>Grab a bowl and mix flour, baking soda, salt and baking powder. In a separate bowl, mix hot water and Godiva hot chocolate until dissolved.</p>

<p>In a large bowl, beat shortening for 30 seconds. Gradually add sugar and beat well after each addition. Add vanilla and eggs, one at a time. Alternate adding flour and cocoa mixture to the mixture, don’t over mix.</p>

<p>Fill muffin cups about 2/3 full.</p>

<p>Bake 20 to 25 minutes. Allow cupcakes to cool slightly before moving them to a cooling rack to cool completely.</p>

<p>Tip: While these were baking, they seemed to puff in the middle then settle so they have a weird hollow middle but once they cool and settled they looked and tasted fine, without any hollow middle. So don’t worry if you go to stick a toothpick in and get a pocket of air.</p>

<p>Happy Baking!</p>

    <p>I love birthdays and no, I don’t just mean my own. I love celebrating life, and the people you love in it. I know many people dread their birthdays, another year, another letdown, blah, blah, blah. If you don’t love celebrating your birthday, at least let others enjoy the celebration, because guess what? You matter!</p>

<p>What better way to let someone know you love them and feel blessed to be a part of their lives than by celebrating the very day they were born? I love making others feel special. Setting aside an entire day just for this purpose is worthy of celebration. I mean, how many days do we set aside for the purpose of blessing someone else? Not many.</p>

<p>What is my point? Well, one of the many reasons I LOVE November is because it is both my birthday month and my sweet hubby’s. Yes, of course I love my birthday but I really love having an excuse to celebrate Jack. So, to continue our “Thankful” series, I am EXTREMELY thankful for Jack.</p>

<p>Jack and I met at church when I was in 5th grade. His mom was the children’s minister and our sisters had played t-ball together. Jack and I didn’t cross paths much until high school however, when my mom’s strategic choreography had us dancing opposite parts in a play for a church fundraiser. Jack played the school principal and I was the librarian (funny now that he’s a librarian). My mother, of course thought she was so sneaky. After a few, not-so-subtle hints from my father that Jack should take me out golfing (my dad eats, drinks, and breathes golf), we decided to do just that. From that day forward a beautiful friendship formed that grew to love and here we are 9 years later, married and living clear across the country from our old stomping grounds.</p>

<p>Jack and I have been married over 3 years now and I wish I could put into words just how incredibly thankful I am to have him as my best friend and husband. Although we have already celebrated his birthday this month, I wanted to officially add him to my list of “things” I’m grateful for and wish him a very happy birthday. Jakie, I’m so glad you were born and so happy with the life we are building together.</p>

<p>Thanksgiving gives us time to reflect on what and who we are most thankful for. Who are you thankful for this Thanksgiving?</p>

    <p>I love November. This is not simply a passing phrase for me, I wholeheartedly love November! November is my Christmas–if a November fairy came to my house, I would clean the chimney, set out cookies and milk, and probably write him a letter.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/11/november-thanks/290127_10150262007229332_675984331_7659481_1956671_o/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/11/290127_10150262007229332_675984331_7659481_1956671_o-325x195.jpg" alt="" title="Family" /></a></p>

<p>There are many aspects of November that I love, however, the best part for me, is of course, Thanksgiving. Growing up, this was always my favorite family holiday. We would all watch the parade, eat German pancakes, and sip hot chocolate. Then mom would get to work making her famous rice salad while dad worked on the turkey. Kendra and I would help where we could and sing along to our favorite tape, “Amy Grant Christmas.” The joy of Thanksgiving was simple–we were together and we were thankful.</p>

<p>This togetherness is what I most love about Thanksgiving. Living in Tennessee, I have come to realize the extent to which I’ve cherished my family’s Thanksgivings together. Four years have gone by without a family Thanksgiving and every year I realize just how much those days meant to me. We are no longer able to be together physically, but I carry my family with me throughout the holidays–continuing their traditions, remembering the past, and looking forward to what the future holds for all of us. I am incredibly grateful for the times we have had together.</p>

<p>In the spirit of Thanksgiving, this month I will be highlighting a few of the many things that I am grateful for and I would LOVE to hear from you too! Leave a comment or head to our facebook page and tell us your favorite Thanksgiving memory, food, tradition, or simply tells us what you are thankful for this year.</p>

<p>Wishing you a very blessed November, may you be filled with thanks and surrounded by those you love and who love you.</p>

    <p><em>The Daring Baker’s October 2011 challenge was Povitica, hosted by Jenni of The Gingered Whisk. Povitica is a traditional Eastern European Dessert Bread that is as lovely to look at as it is to eat!</em></p>

<p>Of course, this being my first attempt, I think it was better to taste than to look at but maybe that’s just me. My first try (see image below) didn’t set up as well as it should have, I think partially because I didn’t grind the walnuts small enough, so this should look more solid than gooey. However, it still tasted great!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/10/october-daring-bakers-challenge-povitica/povitica-007-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/10/Povitica-0071-575x381.jpg" alt="" title="Walnut" /></a></p>

<p>If any of you were brave enough to try last month’s croissant challenge, I have good news for you…this is 100 times easier and takes much less time. Really.</p>

<p>I loved this challenge. Povitica dough is extremely easy to roll out, none of that rebound curling that we had with the croissant dough. And, to make it even better, I thought this entire process was fun. It is a different way of making bread that is intriguing throughout the entire process.</p>

<p>I made one loaf the normal way, with walnuts and what not, two with a pumpkin filling and one with feta, cheddar cheese, and herbs. All of them tasted great. So, although this is meant to be a dessert bread, feel free to substitute the filling with whatever warms the cockles of your heart.</p>

<p><em>A few tips:</em></p>

<p>1.) When the directions say to roll out the dough super thin, DO IT! It really isn’t difficult and it makes the inside look fantastic. You can see in my pumpkin bread especially, I didn’t roll it out as much and the filling wasn’t as thick, making the design harder to appreciate.</p>

<p>2.) Make sure you grind up the walnuts well. I simply crushed them haphazardly and the edges of the large chunks made rolling a tedious process as I attempted not to poke a hole in my dough.</p>

<p>3.) When you roll the dough, don’t try to pick it up as you go, simply push little bits at a time, separating it from your workspace by gently rolling it over the filling mixture.</p>

<p>4.) This bread really is beautiful when done right, thicker less liquidy filling works best. Wrap a 3-in. wide piece of burlap around the middle of the bread with a thinner piece of ribbon, and give away as Christmas gifts.</p>

<p><em>Recipe: Courtesy of Jenni</em><br />
<strong><em>Ingredients</em></strong></p>

<p><em>To activate the Yeast:</em><br />
2 Teaspoons (10 ml/9 gm) Sugar<br />
1 Teaspoon (5 ml/3 gm) All-Purpose (Plain) Flour<br />
½ Cup (120ml) Warm Water<br />
2 Tablespoons (30ml/14 gm/½ oz/2 sachets) Dry Yeast</p>

<p><em>Dough:</em><br />
2 Cups (480ml) Whole Milk<br />
¾ Cup (180 ml/170gm/6 oz) Sugar<br />
3 Teaspoons (15 ml/18 gm/2/3 oz) Table Salt<br />
4 Large Eggs<br />
½ Cup (120ml/115 gm/one stick/4 oz) Unsalted Butter, melted<br />
8 cups (1.92 l/1.12 kg/39½ oz/2½ lb) All-Purpose Flour, measure first then sift, divided</p>

<p><em>Walnut Filling:</em><br />
7 Cups (1.68 l/1.12 kg/2.5 lbs) Ground English Walnuts<br />
1 Cup (240ml) Whole Milk<br />
1 Cup (240ml/225 gm/2 sticks/8 oz) Unsalted Butter<br />
2 Whole Eggs, Beaten<br />
1 Teaspoon (5ml) Pure Vanilla Extract<br />
2 Cups (480ml/450 gm/16 oz) Sugar<br />
1 Teaspoon (5 ml/4 gm) Unsweetened Cocoa Powder<br />
1 Teaspoon (5 ml/3 gm) Cinnamon</p>

<p><em>Topping:</em><br />
½ Cup (120 ml) Cold STRONG Coffee<br />
2 Tablespoons (30 ml/28 gm/1 oz) Granulated Sugar<br />
Melted Butter</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/10/october-daring-bakers-challenge-povitica/povitica-029-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/10/Povitica-0291-325x215.jpg" alt="" title="Povitica 029" /></a></p>

<p><strong><em>Directions:</em></strong></p>

<p><em>To Activate Yeast:</em></p>

<p>In a small bowl, stir 2 teaspoons sugar, 1 teaspoon flour, and the yeast into ½ cup warm water and cover with plastic wrap. Allow to stand for 5 minutes</p>

<p><em>To Make the Dough:</em></p>

<p>1. In a medium saucepan, heat the milk up to just below boiling (about 180°F/82°C), stirring constantly so that a film does not form on the top of the milk. You want it hot enough to scald you, but not boiling. Allow to cool slightly, until it is about 110°F/43°C.<br />
2. In a large bowl, mix the scalded milk, ¾ cup (180 gm/170 gm/6 oz) sugar, and the salt until combined.<br />
3. Add the beaten eggs, yeast mixture, melted butter, and 2 cups (480 ml/280 gm/10 oz) of flour.<br />
4. Blend thoroughly and slowly add remaining flour, mixing well until the dough starts to clean the bowl.<br />
5. Turn dough out onto floured surface and knead, gradually adding flour a little at a time, until smooth and does not stick. Note: You may not use all 8 c. of flour<br />
6. Divide the dough into 4 equal pieces (they will each weight about 1.25 pounds/565 grams)<br />
7. Place dough in 4 lightly oiled bowls, cover loosely with a layer of plastic wrap and then a kitchen towel and let rise an hour and a half in a warm place, until doubled in size.</p>

<p><em>To Make the Filling:</em></p>

<p>1. In a large bowl mix together the ground walnuts, sugar, cinnamon and cocoa.<br />
2. Heat the milk and butter to boiling. Pour the liquid over the nut/sugar mixture.<br />
3. Add the eggs and vanilla and mix thoroughly. Allow to stand at room temperature until ready to be spread on the dough. If the mixture thickens, add a small amount of warm milk.</p>

<p><em>To Roll and Assemble the Dough:</em></p>

<p>1. Spread a clean sheet or cloth over your entire table so that it is covered. (I didn’t use a sheet or cloth) Sprinkle with a couple of tablespoons to a handful of flour (use flour sparingly).<br />
2. Place the dough on the sheet and roll the dough out with a rolling pin, starting in the middle and working your way out, until it measures roughly 10-12 inches (25½ cm by 30½ cm) in diameter<br />
3. Spoon 1 to 1.5 teaspoons (5ml to 7 ½ ml/4 gm to 7 gm) of melted butter on top.<br />
4. Using the tops of your hands, stretch dough out from the center until the dough is thin and uniformly opaque. You can also use your rolling pin, if you prefer.</p>

<p><em>Tip:</em> As you work, continually pick up the dough from the table, not only to help in stretching it out, but also to make sure that it isn’t sticking.</p>

<p>5. When you think the dough is thin enough, try to get it a little thinner. It should be so thin that you can see the color and perhaps the pattern of the sheet or counter underneath.<br />
6. Spoon filling evenly over dough until covered. Lift the edge of the cloth and gently roll the dough like a jelly roll.<br />
7. Once the dough is rolled up into a rope, gently lift it up and place it into a greased loaf pan in the shape of a “U”, with the ends meeting in the middle. You want to coil the dough around itself, as this will give the dough its characteristic look when sliced.<br />
8. Repeat with remaining three loaves, coiling each rope of dough in its own loaf pan.</p>

<p><em>Finishing Touches:</em></p>

<p>1. Brush the top of each loaf with a mixture of ½ cup (120 ml) of cold STRONG coffee and 2 tablespoons (30ml/28 gm/1 oz) of sugar. If you prefer, you can also use egg whites in place of this. Cover pans lightly will plastic wrap and allow to rest for approximately 15 minutes.<br />
2. Preheat oven to moderate 350°F/180°C/gas mark 4.<br />
3. Remove plastic wrap from dough and place into the preheated oven and bake for approximately 15 minutes.<br />
4. Turn down the oven temperature to slow 300°F/150°C/gas mark 2 and bake for an additional 45 minutes, or until done.<br />
5. Remove bread from oven and brush with melted butter.<br />
6. Check the bread at 30 minutes to ensure that the bread is not getting too brown. You may cover the loaves with a sheet of aluminum foil if you need to.<br />
7. Remove from the oven and allow to cool on a wire rack for 20-30 minutes, still in the bread pan. Remember, the bread weighs about 2.5 and it needs to be able to hold its own weight, which is difficult when still warm and fresh out of the oven. Allowing it to cool in the pan helps the loaf to hold its shape.</p>

<p><em>Tip:</em> It is recommended that the best way to cut Povitica loaves into slices is by turning the loaf upside down and slicing with a serrated knife.</p>

    <p>Fall break is over and what a break it was. One of my dearest friends flew out from Oregon with her 1-year-old son and husband. We were able to visit with one another for 5 whole days. It has been 2 years since we have seen friends from home so I cannot express to you just how wonderful it was to be with them again. Jack and I are truly blessed with the friends we have both back home and here in Tennessee. Here’s a family picture from our day out at the farm.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/10/2494/fall-break-2012-008/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/10/Fall-Break-2012-008-575x381.jpg" alt="" title="Friends" /></a></p>

<p>What else did we do on our Fall break? Well, we held a little pumpkin carving party, took a drive up to Roan Mountain, and best of all…attended the Woolly Worm Festival in Banner Elk, North Carolina! Yep, you read it right, the Woolly Worm Festival.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/10/2494/logowoollyworm_300/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/10/logowoollyworm_300.jpg" alt="" title="logowoollyworm_300" /></a></p>

<p>According to their <a href="http://www.woollyworm.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=34&amp;Itemid=56">website</a>, last year’s festival had over 20,000 visitors from all over the East coast and 1,000 participants racing their woolly worms.</p>

<p>I bet you are wondering, “how exactly do you race a woolly worm…?” Up a string of course. The Woolly Worm trainers, race their worms up a 3 ft. string in small heats throughout the day until the final heat in the afternoon, where the finalists compete for $1000. This year’s <a href="http://www.woollyworm.com/">winner</a>, was YoYoMa from NC.</p>

<p>I took some pictures of the festival, they are nothing special but I wanted to give you an idea of how big of a deal this really is…</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/10/2494/fall-break-2012-160/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/10/Fall-Break-2012-160-325x215.jpg" alt="" title="Fall Break 2012 160" /></a></p>
<nbsp>  
Now, don’t mistake this festival for just a hokey Southern gathering. No, there is a point to the worm racing, are you ready for this? Apparently, the woolly worm winner predicts what type of winter we are going to have, week by week, by the width of his stripes.</nbsp>

<p>This year’s weather, week 1-13: Lt Snow &amp; Cold, Cold &amp; Snowy, Cold &amp; Snowy, Cold &amp; Snowy, Lt Snow &amp; Cold, Normal Cold, Cold &amp; Snowy, Cold &amp; Snowy</p>

<p>So there you have it, looks like lots of cold and snowy weather coming our way!</p>

    <p>If I haven’t emphasized it enough over the past few weeks, I <em>really</em> love Fall. I love when the weather starts changing and you can finally wear your favorite sweater. I love how much better a morning cup of coffee tastes when gazing out the window at the drizzling rain. I love little kids running through the pumpkin patch trying to find the perfect pumpkin. I love cinnamon-scented candles and pumpkin pie. I love everything about Fall!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/10/orange-fall-wreath/halloween-wreath-009/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/10/Halloween-wreath-009-575x479.jpg" alt="" title="Halloween wreath" /></a></p>

<p>To add to my list of Fall-centered celebrations, I decided to throw together a wreath for our pumpkin carving party this weekend. This wreath cost me less than $5 and can be adapted for any holiday.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/10/orange-fall-wreath/halloween-wreath-017/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/10/Halloween-wreath-017-325x489.jpg" alt="" title="Halloween wreath 017" /></a></p>

<p><em>Tools:</em></p>

<p>1 tube of pipe insulation, 3 ft. ($.89)<br />
1 yard of fabric (mine was $2)<br />
2 feet of ribbon ($.99)<br />
1 box of straight pins (I had these but they cost about $2)</p>

<p><em>Instructions:</em></p>

<p>Cut fabric into 2x4in strips. Pinch the center and fold the edges up. Stick a straight pin through the point to keep fabric folded together and stick into the wreath, overlapping previous layers.</p>

<p>Once the pipe is covered, tie or glue your ribbon in place. That’s it–a super easy Fall wreath for your door. Mine took about 30 minutes to complete.</p>

<p>Well folks, that’s all I have for you. I hope you are enjoying your Fall as much as I am! I’ll be sure to post some pumpkin carving party pictures soon. Happy Fall!</p>

<p>I have never been a person who claims to like mums. In fact, in the past I have downright hated mums. Why? To be honest, I don’t really know. I think they remind me of marigolds and the orange/gold color of marigolds is just not a color I enjoy seeing outside. However, this year we have a little flower/vegetable shop one minute down the road from us. I pass it every single day on my way to and from class and they have the most beautiful mums.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/10/fall-garden/fall-porch-011/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/10/fall-porch-011-575x381.jpg" alt="" title="fall porch 011" /></a></p>

<p>Maybe it’s the shear amount of mums in one place, maybe its the variety of colors that they carry, or maybe it’s that their prices are stinkin’ cheap–I had to buy some. Jack and I went to the shop after work yesterday and purchased 6 beautiful mums to add a little color to our deck before winter robs us of these beautiful colors.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/10/fall-garden/fall-porch-013/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/10/fall-porch-013-575x381.jpg" alt="" title="fall porch 013" /></a></p>

<p>We woke up to a beautiful sunny morning and I just couldn’t resist popping outdoors for a few minutes to take a few pictures of our Fall porch. I am still working on a wreath (post to come) and perhaps putting our little farmer scarecrow outside but here is what we have so far. Perhaps these pretty buds will inspire you to not give up on your garden just yet–there are still plenty of beautiful fall days to enjoy your flowers.</p>

<p>Don’t forget to throw in some pumpkins as well. The orange looks beautiful with the red and purple mums. I also took a picture of the beautiful purple cabbage Kristin brought me last week. She’s too sweet.</p>

<p>I have one pharmacology test left before Fall break next week. I plan to compile a host of posts for you all over the break so be on the lookout. Last week we had 2 record breaking days for visits on the site. Thank you for your continued support.</p>

<p>Happy Fall!</p>

    <p>_I have one more test before Fall break so I apologize, once again, for the “few and far between” posts. However, today you are in luck… Meredith has written another guest post for you all! Today she is sharing a fabulous recipe for no-knead bread.<br />
_<br />
My husband is the bread-baker in our family. When I met him, I’d been baking my own bread for about a year, because I’m a good baker. There’s no reason I shouldn’t be able to do bread. But I’d messed it up differently every time. Forgot the salt. Didn’t knead long enough. Under-baked. Burned. Wrong, wrong, wrong.</p>

<p>Then I met Jon, who worked at a bakery in our neighborhood. A wonderful bakery, with fabulous artisan breads, baked in an amazing multi-deck stone hearth oven. At the time, he worked mixing and benching, and eventually he started baking. He brought home more bread than we could eat. Then he started practicing at home. He never forgets the salt.</p>

<p>So I quit messing with bread. We moved to Northeast Tennessee, and our artisan bread options are limited. Jon bakes some, but he’s working full-time and going to school full-time, and time is precious. So we’ve been making do with the grocery store stuff, the sliced kind for my son’s pb &amp; j’s, and an occasional “artisan-style” loaf for my morning toast.</p>

<p>Then <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/08/dining/081mrex.html">Jim Lahey’s no-knead bread</a>, no stone hearth required, started drifting in and out of my attention. I vaguely remember hearing about this on NPR some years ago, and not really paying attention because I’m not the bread-baker.  But a little over a year ago, a friend served no-knead bread at a dinner party. And it was delicious. Then, for Christmas, we received Amanda Hesser’s <em>The Essential New York Times Cookbook: Classic Recipes for a New Century,</em> which reprints favorites from the past 150 years or so of <em>Times</em> food writing. And it includes this recipe. Several months later, I’ve finally gotten around to trying it. (It was the first esting time that got me. Figuring out when to start this so that 12-18 hours later I could work with it, and then have 3 more hours or so before it was finished required waaay too much math.)</p>

<p>Yesterday, after really wanting toast for breakfast and having Corn Flakes instead, I decided to try it.  While the kids ate dinner, I put together the dough.</p>

<ul>
  <li>3 Cups all-purpose flour</li>
  <li>1/4 teaspoon instant yeast</li>
  <li>1 1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
  <li>1 1/2 cups water</li>
</ul>

<div>     Mix together in a large bowl. Cover with plastic wrap, and let rest 12-18 hours.</div>

<div>This morning, the dough had risen considerably, and was speckled with bubbles about to break through. I let it go until 10:15 or so, about 16 hours after I’d mixed it up (less because of its readiness – Hesser says 18 hours is preferable, but that it’s ready when covered with little bubbles – and more because that timing worked out well for my chances of working without the kids’ “help.”)</div>

<div>     Here the directions say to turn the dough out onto a lightly floured board, and fold over itself once or twice. I chose twice, and the dough smoothed into a neat little roundish packet. After covering it loosely with plastic wrap and letting it rest 15 minutes, I floured my hands, shaped it into a ball (sort of – it’s a really loose dough), and set it on a towel (not terrycloth) covered with cornmeal. A little more cornmeal on top, cover with another towel, and let rise 2-2 1/2 hours. When it’s ready to bake, it won’t spring back readily when pressed with fingertips.</div>

<div>     While it rose (just before taking my kids upstairs for naptime), I turned on the oven to preheat my pot. I’m saving my money and watching clearance racks for [dream pot](http://www.csnstores.com/popups/media_viewer_images.php?sku=SAB1087), so this time I just used my regular All Clad stainless 8 quart soup pot. A heavier pot with a tighter-fitting lid probably would’ve worked better, but this one did just fine. I heated it at 450 while I put the kids down, and by the time they were asleep the bread was ready to go. Out came the pot, in went the bread, down went the lid, and into the oven. After half an hour, I took the lid off, and left it for another 20 minutes or so to brown up.</div>

<div>     And I have to say, it’s decent bread. Not quite as tall as I might like, perhaps, but for the effort expended . . . it’s fantastic! And it’ll hold up admirably to butter &amp; jam in the morning. I’m a happy girl.</div>

    <p>Tuesday evening was the night you’ve all been waiting for…the pumpkin workshop. I think I say this every time but, this workshop just might be my absolute favorite. The pumpkin workshop brings a little sophistication to the traditional idea of carving pumpkins for the fall.</p>

<p>I went straight to the workshop from class so these photos are courtesy of Linda. Thank you Linda!</p>

<p>The pumpkin below was the demo pumpkin I made for the group.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/09/flower-pumpkin-workshop/dsc_0692/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/09/DSC_0692-325x479.jpg" alt="" title="Tiffany's Pumpkin" /></a></p>

<p>Would you like to make your very own flower pumpkin? Here’s what you need and a few pointers to get you started:</p>

<p><strong>Tools:</strong></p>

<p>1 pumpkin (any size)<br />
1 plastic cup (like the coca cola ones from McDonalds, the height depends on how big your pumpkin is)<br />
Flowers<br />
1 block of oasis</p>

<p>**Directions:<br />
**<br />
1. Soak a block of oasis in water.<br />
2. Trace the rim of your cup on top of the pumpkin. Cut along the traced line.<br />
3. Hollow out the inside of your pumpkin.<br />
4. Cut oasis edges so it fits snugly into your plastic cup, leave the oasis slightly higher than the cup’s rim.<br />
5. Insert cup into the pumpkin and add water to the cup.<br />
6. Insert flower stems into the oasis as you shape your arrangement.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/09/flower-pumpkin-workshop/dsc_0688/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/09/DSC_0688-325x489.jpg" alt="" title="DSC_0688" /></a> (Below: Kristin’s Pumpkin)</p>

<p>Now comes the fun part, the flowers! Don’t let a lack of flowers deter you from attempting this project. You can use pretty much anything to fill your pumpkin, leaves, grasses, bushes, dried flowers, fresh flowers, weeds, etc.</p>

<p>Start with a plant that will drape the top of your pumpkin, so the rim of the cup and oasis do not show. I chose peppers and weeds with berries because they are heavy enough to drape down over the pumpkin.</p>

<p>Next, choose 1 or 2 fillers to give some weight to the base of the arrangement and fill in the larger spaces. I used bunches of goldenrod and a few branches of leaves with a different texture than the leaves towards the bottom of the pumpkin.</p>

<p>Now, choose a few staple flowers to draw the eye. You want your main flowers to stay fairly low to the pumpkin, anchoring the arrangement (notice the height of my pink dahlia and Kristin’s red dahlia).</p>

<p>After that, I basically just add extra ornamentals of varying heights for finishing touches. There are blue berry-like pods (castor bean), cattails, and some longer stems of goldenrod for height.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/09/flower-pumpkin-workshop/dsc_0821/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/09/DSC_0821-575x434.jpg" alt="" title="DSC_0821" /></a></p>

And, just to prove that you can put together a spectacular looking pumpkin with a variety of plants, here are just a few of the pumpkins from Tuesday’s crew.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/09/flower-pumpkin-workshop/dsc_0729/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/09/DSC_0729-103x150.jpg" alt="" title="DSC_0729" /></a></p>

<p>They were all so wonderful but I can only fit so many pictures into my post. Be sure to let the ladies know how wonderful their pumpkins look and if you put together a pumpkin of your own, send us a picture!</p>

    <p>I had the privilege of participating in my first ever “Daring Baker” challenge. What is Daring Baker? Daring Baker comes from <a href="http://thedaringkitchen.com">The Daring Kitchen</a> a website that challenges both bloggers and non-bloggers to a different baking or cooking challenge each month. The bloggers attempt a difficult recipe, then blog about it on the same day each month, revealing to their readers what the secret challenge was. I joined in August and was ready for my first challenge this month, and what a time to start!</p>

<p>The Daring Bakers go retro this month! Thanks to one of our very talented non-blogging members, Sarah, the Daring Bakers were challenged to make Croissants using a recipe from the Queen of French Cooking, none other than Julia Child!</p>

<p>Lucky for me, croissants are a baking challenge I’d been dying to try ever since watching “It’s Complicated”-with their bakery scene making pain au chocolat (chocolate croissants).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/09/september-daring-baker-challenge/chili-croissants-115/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/09/chili-croissants-115-575x320.jpg" alt="" title="Apple Croissants" /></a></p>

<p>Now, I don’t know how many of you realize how truly involved the process of baking croissants can be (I didn’t). Perhaps you have a never-fail family recipe that you can whip up and serve hot, fluffy croissants in a jiff…</p>

<p>This is not one of those recipes.</p>

<p>My dough sat overnight twice, if that gives you an idea of the time investment. It is possible to make these in one day, if you have one FULL day to spend on croissant making (it takes 12 hours). I, however, did not. So there, you are warned.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/09/september-daring-baker-challenge/chili-croissants-130/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/09/chili-croissants-130-325x215.jpg" alt="" title="chili, croissants 130" /></a></p>

<p>I was surprisingly happy with how my croissants turned out, that is until I went to our secret forum to see the other blogger’s results. Some of them were out of this world fantastic. I’m jealous.</p>

<p>However, to be a good sport (and show you that croissants can be well-worth the effort), I am posting links to some of the croissant-bakers blogs that seemed to really outdo themselves. Be sure to visit and show them some love.</p>

<p><a href="http://cuisinea4mains.wordpress.com/">cuisine a 4 mains</a><br />
<a href="http://lagalletika.com/">la galletika</a><br />
<a href="http://carlysulli.wordpress.com/">Tart to Heart</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/09/september-daring-baker-challenge/chili-croissants-020/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/09/chili-croissants-020-325x215.jpg" alt="" title="Envelope Fold" /></a></p>

<p>I think I’ve decided my issue was the second dough rise. I’m not exactly sure what went wrong (I followed the instructions to a T), perhaps the Tennessee humidity was my downfall. Hmmm…</p>

<p>I also wanted them to be a bit darker than the result. I did a double egg wash, coating the dough in a generous amount of egg/milk mix, and then again right before placing into the oven. Others did the same process with a much different result.</p>

<p>I read a few tips that may help those who prefer a dark shell:</p>

<p>1. use a pan that has low edges/rim so it doesn’t block heat from gliding across the croissants<br />
2. space out your croissants placing only 6 on a pan (I put all 12 on one pan) in order to allow more circulation of heat</p>

<p><a href="http://audaxartifex.blogspot.com/">Audax Artifex</a> has some great tips to getting beautiful croissants.</p>

<p>I ended up making a few plain croissants, pain au cholocat, and apples and cinnamon.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/09/september-daring-baker-challenge/chili-croissants-090/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/09/chili-croissants-090-325x215.jpg" alt="" title="chili, croissants 090" /></a></p>

<p>And without further ado, for the brave at heart, Julia Child’s Recipe (Mastering the Art of French Cooking, Vol. 2). I have grouped the steps into manageable segments.</p>

<p><em>Ingredients</em></p>

<p>¼ oz (7 gm) of fresh yeast, or 1¼ teaspoon (6¼ ml/4 gm) of dry-active yeast (about ½ sachet)<br />
3 tablespoons (45 ml) warm water (less than 100°F/38°C)<br />
1 teaspoon (5 ml/4½ gm) sugar<br />
1 3/4 cups (225 gm/½ lb) of strong plain flour (I used Polish all-purpose flour, which is 13% protein)<br />
2 teaspoons (10 ml/9 gm) sugar<br />
1½ teaspoon (7½ ml/9 gm) salt<br />
½ cup (120 ml/¼ pint) milk (I am not sure if the fat content matters. I used 2%)<br />
2 tablespoons (30 ml) tasteless oil (I used generic vegetable oil)<br />
½ cup (120 ml/1 stick/115 gm/¼ lb) chilled, unsalted butter<br />
1 egg, for egg wash</p>

<p><em>Directions:</em></p>

<p>1. Mix the yeast, warm water, and first teaspoon of sugar in a small bowl. Allow the yeast and sugar to dissolve and the yeast to foam slightly.<br />
2. Measure out the other ingredients and heat the milk until tepid, dissolve in the salt and remaining sugar.<br />
3. Scoop flour into a large bowl. Add oil, yeast mixture, and milk. Mix with a rubber spatula, don’t over mix.<br />
4. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface, and let it rest while you wash out the bowl.<br />
5. Knead the dough eight to ten times. Check out this video from Julia Child.<br />
6. Place the dough back in the bowl, and place the entire bowl in a plastic bag.<br />
7. Leave the bowl at approximately 75°F/24°C for three hours, or until the dough has tripled in size.</p>

<p>8. After the dough has tripled in size, remove it gently from the bowl, pulling it away from the sides of the bowl with your fingertips.<br />
9. Place the dough on a lightly floured board or countertop, and use your hands to press it out into a rectangle, about 8 X 12 inches (20cm X 30cm).<br />
10. Fold the dough rectangle in three, like a letter (fold the top third down, and then the bottom third up).<br />
11. Place the dough letter back in the bowl, and the bowl back in the plastic bag. Leave the dough to rise for another 1.5 hours, or until it has doubled in size. This second rise can be done overnight in the fridge.</p>

<p>12. Place the double-risen dough onto a plate and cover tightly with plastic wrap. Place the plate in the fridge while you prepare the butter.<br />
13. Once the dough has doubled, it’s time to incorporate the butter. Place the block of chilled butter on a chopping board.<br />
14. Using the rolling pin, beat the butter down a little, till it is quite flat. Use the heel of your hand to continue to spread the butter until it is smooth. You want the butter to stay cool, but spread easily.<br />
15.Remove the dough from the fridge and place it on a lightly floured board or counter. Let it rest for a minute or two.<br />
16. Spread the dough using your hands into a rectangle about 14 X 8 inches (35 cm bX 20 cm).<br />
17. Remove the butter from the board, and place it on the top half of the dough rectangle.<br />
18. Spread the butter all across the top two-thirds of the dough rectangle, but keep it ¼ inch (6 mm) across from all the edges.<br />
19.. Fold the top third of the dough down, and the bottom third of the dough up. Turn the dough package 90 degrees, so that the top flap is to your right (like a book).<br />
20. Roll out the dough package (gently, so you don’t push the butter out of the dough) until it is again about 14 X 8 inches (35 cm bX 20 cm). Again, fold the top third down and the bottom third up.<br />
21. Wrap the dough package in plastic wrap, and place it in the fridge for 2 hours.</p>

<p>22. After two hours have passed, take the dough out of the fridge and place it again on the lightly floured board or counter.<br />
23. Tap the dough with the rolling pin, to deflate it a little. Let the dough rest for 8 to 10 minutes.<br />
24. Roll the dough package out till it is 14 X 8 inches (35 cm X 20 cm). Fold in three, as before.<br />
25. Turn 90 degrees, and roll out again to 14 X 8 inches (35 cm X 20 cm). Fold in three for the last time, wrap in plastic, and return the dough package to the fridge for two more hours (or overnight, with something heavy on top to stop it from rising).</p>

<p>26. It’s now time to cut the dough and shape the croissants.First, lightly butter your baking sheet.<br />
27. Take the dough out of the fridge and let it rest for ten minutes on the lightly floured board or counter. Roll the dough out into a 20 X 5 inch rectangle (51 cm X 12½ cm).<br />
28. Cut the dough into two rectangles (each 10 X 5 inches (25½ cm X 12½ cm). Place one of the rectangles in the fridge, to keep the butter cold.<br />
29. Roll the second rectangle out until it is 15 X 5 inches (38 cm X 12½ cm).<br />
30. Cut the rectangle into three squares (each 5 X 5 inches (12½ cm X 12½ cm). Place two of the squares in the fridge<br />
31. The remaining square may have shrunk up a little bit in the meantime. Roll it out again till it is nearly square. Cut the square diagonally into two triangles.<br />
32. Stretch the triangle out a little, so it is not a right-angle triangle, but more of an isosceles.<br />
33. Starting at the wide end, roll the triangle up towards the point, and curve into a crescent shape.<br />
34. Place the unbaked croissant on the baking sheet<br />
35. Repeat the process with the remaining squares of dough, creating 12 croissants in total.<br />
36. Leave the tray of croissants, covered lightly with plastic wrap, to rise for 1 hour.</p>

<p>37. Preheat the oven to very hot 475°F/240°C/gas mark 9.<br />
38. Mix the egg with a teaspoon of water (or milk). Spread the egg wash across the tops of the croissants.<br />
39. Put the croissants in the oven for 12 to 15 minutes, until the tops are browned nicely.<br />
40. Take the croissants out of the oven, and place them on a rack to cool for 10 minutes before serving.</p>

<p>If you give these a try I would love to see the result so be sure to take pictures and send them my way. I’m hoping to give them another try soon. Best of luck and I look forward to sharing next month’s Daring Baker challenge with you all.</p>

    <p>This past week I found myself welcoming Fall with open arms, hazelnut coffee, and sweaters! Oh the sweaters. My poor husband has heard little else this past week other than, I need more sweaters (need being a bit of an exaggeration). The point is, I love sweaters. Moving on.</p>

<div id="attachment_2219" style="width: 585px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">[![](jekyll_uploads/2011/09/chocolate-pie-quesadilla-bruschetta-lake-013-575x381.jpg "Sunflower, Pink Dahlia")](http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/09/fall-is-in-the-air/chocolate-pie-quesadilla-bruschetta-lake-013/)

Sunflower, Pink Dahlia

</div>

<p>The only disappointing part of fall is when I walk out onto my porch to find all of my flowers fading away. I love flowers, just about as much as I love my sweaters, so it is always unfortunate to realize I won’t be seeing their beautiful petals for 3-6 months (depending on location).</p>

<div id="attachment_2220" style="width: 585px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">[![](jekyll_uploads/2011/09/chocolate-pie-quesadilla-bruschetta-lake-018-575x381.jpg "Delphinium, Mountain Mint, Sedum")](http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/09/fall-is-in-the-air/chocolate-pie-quesadilla-bruschetta-lake-018/)

Delphinium, Mountain Mint, Sedum

</div>

<p>On that note…I decided to share a few pictures of the last Saturday Market bouquets I helped make (just in case you are missing your flowers too). These bouquets were from 3 or 4 weeks ago.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/09/fall-is-in-the-air/chocolate-pie-quesadilla-bruschetta-lake-026/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/09/chocolate-pie-quesadilla-bruschetta-lake-026-575x381.jpg" alt="" title="Zinnias, Sedum" /></a></p>

<p>I hope these bouquets bring a little bit of joy to your day. Stay tuned for a very exciting, 3 day baking project I recently completed for the Daring Baker challenge. Big reveal on the 27th!</p>

<p>Happy Fall!</p>

    <p>There are so many ways to use those last few batches of basil in your summer garden. Here are a few we’ve enjoyed throughout the summer. Remember you can also hang basil to dry and then crush it up to use for seasoning all winter long, or you can pulse it in your food processor and make pesto ice cubes ready to be melted into pasta dishes, dips or spreads.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/09/multi-purpose-pesto-recipes/market-flowers-102/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/09/Market-Flowers-102-575x381.jpg" alt="" title="Pesto Butter" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>

<p>15-20 basil leaves<br />
2 tbsp sunflower seeds (the insides)<br />
1 tbsp olive oil<br />
pepper/salt to taste<br />
2 tsp garlic or 1 clove of garlic<br />
1/4 c. butter<br />
1 wood cutting board</p>

<p><em>Butter Pesto</em></p>

<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>

<p>Pull out butter so it can warm to room temperature.</p>

<p>Chop your basil leaves into very very tiny pieces. You should sharpen your knife, if possible, before chopping the leaves, you want to be able to cut through the leaf without the edges turning black (which happens with a dull knife). Once you have minced the leaves, pour a handful of sunflower seeds (no shell) over the top of the basil and mince finely. You will continue to chop, scrape, and gather the mixture.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/09/multi-purpose-pesto-recipes/beans-party-024/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/09/Beans-Party-024-325x215.jpg" alt="" title="Beans Party 024" /></a></p>

<p>Add 1 tbsp of olive oil (right onto the cutting board), 1 tsp. at a time (for a total of 3 tsp/1tbsp). Continue to mix and chop, mix and chop. Add pepper, salt, and garlic to mix (mince cloves before adding to the mixture). Once you are satisified with the consistency dump the pesto into a bowl with the butter. Use a fork to combine ingredients. And voila, pesto butter. Sometimes I add a dash or two of lemon to the mix as well.</p>

<nbsp>  
Jack and I use the pesto butter on our corn instead of plain ol’ butter. It is SO delicious and definitely worth trying out at least once.</nbsp>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/09/multi-purpose-pesto-recipes/beans-party-048/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/09/Beans-Party-048-575x306.jpg" alt="" title="Beans Party 048" /></a><br />
<em>Pesto Bread Dip</em></p>

<p>For those of you who, like us, fancy going out to eat just so you can chow down on warm bread with oil &amp; balsamic vinegar dip, you can use the ingredients above to make your very own dipping mixture. Simply, use the recipe below in a dish of olive oil with 2 tsp. of balsamic vinegar. This is quick and easy to throw together. Of course, you may have to try your hand at homemade baguettes to truly enjoy.</p>

<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>

<p>Same as above, minus butter<br />
2 tbsp. olive oil<br />
2 tsp. balsamic vinegar</p>

<p>(Adjust to fit your individual tastes. We like lots of vinegar!)</p>

<p><em>Traditional Pesto</em></p>

<p>If you prefer traditional pesto, the steps are the same as pesto butter but with more of each ingredient and obviously, no butter.</p>

<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>

<p>2 c. basil leaves<br />
Adjust seasoning to fit your tastes (a good batch needs about 3 cloves of garlic)<br />
1/4 c. olive oil for decent consistency (don’t add onto cutting board as with pesto butter, mix i n bowl)<br />
Roughly 1/3 c. shredded Parmigiano Reggiano</p>

<p>Of course you can make both pesto butter and pesto more quickly with a food processor, but there are pros to chopping by hand. I’ll be honest, I only started making pesto by hand because I do not own a food processor. (<em>Gasp</em>) Although it takes more time, chopping your pesto mix by hand is well worth the effort. Hand chopping gives the pesto a coarse texture that has bold pops of flavor in every bite.</p>

<p>Hope this post inspires you to make the most of that last bit of garden basil. As always, leave a comment or shoot me an email if you need any clarification. Enjoy!</p>

    <p>This was the day. The day that I said, it can wait no more. This was the day I thought, “I <em>must</em> write an absolutely outstanding blog post for my readers today.”</p>

<p>It is now 8 p.m. and after 6 hours of mixing, rolling, stamping (yep, cookie stamps), and packaging 250 cookies for the Milligan College advancement office, I have decided that this is <strong>not</strong> the day.</p>

<p>Jack decided to document me after 6 straight hours of standing, mixing, etc. This is what I look like right now…</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/09/2164/milligan-cookies-027/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/09/Milligan-cookies-027-575x381.jpg" alt="" title="Milligan cookies 027" /></a></p>

<p>Here is me with 120 of my lovely cookies.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/09/2164/milligan-cookies-028/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/09/Milligan-cookies-028-575x928.jpg" alt="" title="Milligan cookies 028" /></a></p>

<p>Here is me baking the last batch of cookies and imitating someone. I’m not really as mad as I look, I just get a little cranky when I’ve been standing this long.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/09/2164/milligan-cookies-036/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/09/Milligan-cookies-036-325x416.jpg" alt="" title="Milligan cookies 036" /></a></p>

<p>Me, wondering how much longer Jack is going to snap photos.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/09/2164/milligan-cookies-032/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/09/Milligan-cookies-032-575x381.jpg" alt="" title="Milligan cookies 032" /></a></p>

<p>And, of course, the cookies. The “M” is for MILLIGAN!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/09/2164/milligan-cookies-054/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/09/Milligan-cookies-054-575x381.jpg" alt="" title="Milligan cookies 054" /></a></p>

<p>I have mentioned this recipe multiple times, but just in case you haven’t tried it yet here are my <a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/02/rummy-shortbread-cookies/">super yummy &amp; simple shortbread cookies</a>.</p>

<p>I am off to cram in a few hours of studying for my MedSurg test. Sorry I couldn’t roll out the blogging magic today folks. I promise I’ll make it up to you.</p>

<p>Thanks for stopping by!</p>

    <p>Are you ready for the easiest pillowcase-making tutorial ever?! I know I’ve mentioned it before, but I like my projects to look fabulous and take a grand total of 10 minutes. It’s not that I’m impatient (I am) and it’s not that I get bored easily (I do), the problem is I have too many things to do and not enough time to do them (right). Whatever the reasoning, these pillowcases satisfy my need to craft along with my A.D.D. lifestyle.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/09/10-minute-pillowcase-tutorial/sandwich-pillows-small-flowers-156/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/07/sandwich-pillows-small-flowers-156-575x381.jpg" alt="" title="sandwich, pillows, small flowers 156" /></a></p>

<p>First, cut a strip of fabric that will wrap once + 8 in. around the pillow (meaning the fabric should fold around the pillow snugly and overlap itself by 8 in.). This fabric should also be 2 inches wider than the pillow. You want the pillowcase to look full so don’t worry about cutting the sides of your fabric too small.</p>

<p>Next, hem in one end (not side) of the fabric, 1/2 in, nothing fancy, just a simple fold over and hem.</p>

<p>After hemming, place fabric right side up with the unhemmed side closest to you. Fold about 1/3 of the fabric on the hemmed side down (toward you), so right sides touch. This edge will end up being on the outside of the pillow.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/09/10-minute-pillowcase-tutorial/sandwich-pillows-small-flowers-137-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/07/sandwich-pillows-small-flowers-137-2-575x402.jpg" alt="" title="sandwich, pillows, small flowers 137-2" /></a></p>

<p>Next, fold up (away from you) the unhemmed side and overlap the hemmed edge by 8 inches. (see picture). Your folds might not split the fabric exactly into thirds, the main point is that when you fold the unhemmed side back over the hemmed side, it MUST overlap by at least 8 inches.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/09/10-minute-pillowcase-tutorial/sandwich-pillows-small-flowers-139/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/07/sandwich-pillows-small-flowers-139-575x381.jpg" alt="" title="sandwich, pillows, small flowers 139" /></a></p>

<p>Pin in place. Sew a 1 in. strip down the two open sides. Flip pillowcase inside out.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/09/10-minute-pillowcase-tutorial/sandwich-pillows-small-flowers-141/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/07/sandwich-pillows-small-flowers-141-575x349.jpg" alt="" title="sandwich, pillows, small flowers 141" /></a></p>

<p>Insert pillow and enjoy your fabulous handiwork!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/09/10-minute-pillowcase-tutorial/sandwich-pillows-small-flowers-144/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/07/sandwich-pillows-small-flowers-144-575x390.jpg" alt="" title="sandwich, pillows, small flowers 144" /></a></p>

<p>I’ll be honest I’m not great at writing out tutorials so if you have questions or need more pictures of the process let me know. I’ll try to get a few more pics up to clarify the steps. Good luck and happy sewing!</p>

    <p><em>Our guest post this week comes from Meredith of <a href="http://blog.maeburn.org">Garden in the South</a>. Meredith is a talented cook, wife, and mother of two adorable children. She is our College Archivist and Information Resources Librarian. Jack and Meredith work together at the library and I’m so grateful they do because I have had the pleasure of getting to know her these past 2 years and she is fabulous! She cans, cooks, bakes amazing baklava and so much more. Please be sure to head over to her blog and show her a bit of love today.</em></p>

<p>First of all, I’d like to thank Tiffany for asking me to guest post! I blog (such as it is) at <a href="http://blog.maeburn.org" title="Garden in the South">Garden in the South</a>, but not nearly as often, or with as much focus as I’d like. <em>C’est la vie</em>, for now. But I love The Kitchen Curtains, and everything Tiffany posts I think, “Oooh! I want to try that!” So this is an honor.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/09/guest-post-mint-milk-with-chocolate-ice-cubes/mint/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/06/mint.jpg" alt="" title="mint" /></a></p>

    <tr>
      <td>The other day, my friend Sarah sent me a link to this [Vanilla Milk with Chocolate Ice Cubes](http://translate.google.com/translate?client=tmpg&amp;hl=en&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fsandrakavital.blogspot.com%2F2008%2F08%2Fchocolat-det-frais-et-gourmand.html&amp;langpair=fr</td>
      <td>en “Le Petrin”) at <em>Le Pétrin</em> (Google translates this as “Trouble.” That seems an apt title, given the deliciousness of this recipe, and how much of it I want to drink.) I had to make it immediately, but first I had to go to the store for some chocolate (because all of mine was old and chalky looking) and instant coffee powder (which I generally do without, but often wish I had). I considered Via, because it’s better, but went with Maxwell House, because I think it’ll mix in more completely, being that it’s freeze-dried. Via, which I’ll drink in a pinch, is super-finely ground, and so doesn’t dissolve well. Also, it’s crazy expensive. So $2 jar of Maxwell House it is.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>I also did not have a vanilla bean. Sarah used one for her Vanilla Milk, and I suspect it’s essential. In something this simple, extract might be a bit harsh. I also live far from my spice <a href="http://www.penzeys.com" title="Penzey's Spices">purveyor</a> of choice, and definitely couldn’t wait for shipping. But I do have a beautiful pot of fresh mint, and very fond memories of a <a href="http://www.williams-sonoma.com/recipe/fresh-mint-chocolate-truffle-tart.html" title="Pure deliciousness">Fresh Mint-Chocolate Truffle Tart</a> I’ve made a few times. Mint is refreshing, of course, and perfect for summer, but the herbal quality of the fresh mint steeped in the cream is a little unexpected and wonderful. So I decided to go with Mint Milk, instead. And I’m so very glad I did. I’m sure the Vanilla Milk is wonderful, but the Mint . . . Seriously. This might become a staple in my refrigerator. The Chocolate Ice is nice – it melts into the milk, and I think it’d be good in all sorts of drinks. But it was all my husband and I could do not to drink the milk right up, and make more immediately.</p>

<p>So here’s the recipe. I was going to be all helpful and do the metric-American conversion, but then I realized my handy 2-cup Pyrex has mls on the other side, and I’ll bet yours does, too.</p>

<p><strong>For the Chocolate Ice</strong>:</p>

<p>200 ml milk</p>

<p>50 ml water</p>

<p>1 T instant coffee</p>

<p>1 T unsweetened cocoa powder</p>

<p>1 t sugar</p>

<p>70 g dark chocolate, 66% (I used a combination of 82% and 60%, because I forgot to write down what I needed before I went to the store, and was thinking I was looking for 77%. It worked out ok.)</p>

<p>Whisk the coffee, cocoa powder, and sugar together in a small saucepan. Whisk in the milk &amp; water, and bring to a boil over medium heat, whisking often. Meanwhile, finely chop the chocolate, and put into heatproof, pourable vessel (I used the aforementioned 2-cup Pyrex.) Pour hot liquid over chocolate. Let stand a few minutes, and whisk smooth. (The original suggests a wooden spoon, but I’m pretty excited about my new 4-inch whisk, so I used it.) Pour into ice cube tray, and freeze. This made 12 cubes for me.</p>

<p><strong>For the Mint Milk</strong>:</p>

<p>600 ml milk (I used 500 ml 1%, which is what I had, with 100 ml 1/2 &amp; 1/2 for richness. I think I’d just use the 1% next time – I’m not sure the creaminess added that much.)</p>

<p>60 g sugar (about 1/4 cup)</p>

<p>8-10 sprigs fresh mint</p>

<p>Heat the milk &amp; sugar in a small saucepan over medium heat, stirring frequently. When milk is very hot and sugar dissolved, remove from heat, toss in mint sprigs, and cover. Let steep half an hour or so (I forgot to look at the clock when I started, which, of course, I didn’t realize until some time later.) Remove mint, and chill. I poured it through a strainer into a Mason jar, but there wasn’t really anything to strain out.</p>

<p><strong>To Serve</strong>:</p>

<p>Place 2-3 cubes chocolate in glasses, and pour milk over. This recipe makes 4 servings (at three cubes each, and milk divided 4 ways.) I think next time, I’ll double the milk, and use 2 cubes per serving. We had a hard time sipping slowly enough to let the chocolate melt in, and ended up topping off with regular milk (and a splash of Bailey’s) just so we’ll have more Mint Milk left for tonight. But, seriously, the Mint Milk? You <strong>must</strong> try it.</p>

    <p>If you haven’t figured it out yet, there is no method to my kitchen madness. I sort through buckets of recipes and after “getting the gist” of the ingredients needed, I just go at it. Sometimes I substitute ingredients because I’m curious, and other times simply because I don’t have an ingredient. Really, it is only through great pains and a lot of luck that I am able to produce something resembling a recipe for you each week.</p>

<p>Why am I telling you this?</p>

<p>I made this dip. It was fantastic.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/08/tomatillo-avocado-dip/beans-party-035/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/08/Beans-Party-035-575x426.jpg" alt="" title="Tomatillo &amp; Avocado Dip" /></a><br />
However, I didn’t measure all the ingredients.</p>

<p>The recipe I’ve written below should be very close to the original, but be sure to taste as you go and adjust if needed.</p>

<p>I know many of you have never used tomatillos before, but trust me they are worth the gamble. Tomatillos are delicious when mixed with the right ingredients. They are responsible for the tart flavor in many Mexican green sauces. I encourage you to give them a try and add a new ingredient to your family meals.</p>

<p><strong>Tomatillo Avocado Dip</strong></p>

<p><em>Ingredients:</em></p>

<p>2 tomatillos<br />
1 avocado<br />
1 tbsp half and half<br />
1 tbsp lemon<br />
2 tsp garlic<br />
1 tsp pepper<br />
1/2 tsp salt</p>

<p><em>Instructions:</em></p>

<p>Remove skin and pit of avocado. Chop tomatillos into smaller chunks. Combine all ingredients in a blender or food processor. Use the half and half to smooth out the dip.</p>

<p>Serve with your favorite chip or a plateful of fresh veggies and enjoy!</p>

    <p>For those of you who know me well, you know how, shall we say, “unmotivated” I am when it comes to school. It’s not that I don’t like to learn, I just like to “do” more. I am a practical application kind of gal.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/08/end-of-summerstart-of-school/chocolate-pie-quesadilla-bruschetta-lake-215/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/08/chocolate-pie-quesadilla-bruschetta-lake-215-575x381.jpg" alt="" title="ME" /></a></p>

<p>After graduating from high school, I made the “mistake” (my mother hates it when I refer to it as such) of taking a year off from school to work in Ukraine. Despite being a worthy cause, that one year of actually <strong>doing</strong> something worthwhile made going back to school to learn about doing something worthwhile much more difficult. It didn’t help that not long after my return, Jack and I were engaged and soon living in Tennessee. Before the wedding I attended a community college in order to incur as little debt as possible while working my way through a psychology degree. After moving to Tennessee and finding that very few of my credits were transferable, I decided to switch majors.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/08/end-of-summerstart-of-school/chocolate-pie-quesadilla-bruschetta-lake-161/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/08/chocolate-pie-quesadilla-bruschetta-lake-161-325x489.jpg" alt="" title="chocolate pie, quesadilla, bruschetta, lake 161" /></a></p>

<p>And here we are, present day, I am now a nursing major, not a place I ever thought I would end up. I used to picture myself as a sophisticated New York business woman carrying a leather briefcase, rocking the power suit, and running all around town with 4-inch heels. Now I am a disheveled Tennessee student carrying a 40 lb bag of nursing books, rocking my sweats, and running all around the hilly campus in my $2 flipflops.</p>

<p>Why am I giving you this snapshot of my college life? If you haven’t guessed yet, this was my first week back in class. This is the second time in my college life that I have been classified as a junior (that’s as far as I made it last time). Although I am still young I feel very old and very behind where I would like to be. When I go to class, I look across the lecture hall at the new generation of college students filing loudly into their seats, and although our ages are not too far apart, our worlds are. Their fashion choices confuse me and I constantly find that I have no knowledge of the media icons they imitate or the bands that ring out from their fancy iphones. It seems our worlds are worlds apart.</p>

<p>All of these factors contribute to my lack of motivation to be in school. However, I am officially on the downward slope, provided there are no more unexpected surprises up ahead, and attempting to constantly remind myself of that fact. Despite being a married, bill-paying, car constantly breaking down, working three jobs while going to school adult, I have successfully completed my first week back and I find myself still smiling.</p>

<nbsp>  
I believe I owe Jake much credit on the smiles. You see, Jake thought I needed to get away before the chaos began again (for him too as he continues his Master’s degree). [![](jekyll_uploads/2011/08/chocolate-pie-quesadilla-bruschetta-lake-199-325x229.jpg "Jakie")](http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/08/end-of-summerstart-of-school/chocolate-pie-quesadilla-bruschetta-lake-199/) So on Tuesday (my last day of summer), we went out to the lake at Watauga Point. It was an absolutely gorgeous day here in Tennessee and we decided to take along a picnic. After our yummy turkey sandwiches we played a grueling game of catch with our fluorescent Nerf football followed by a bit of trail exploring and finally, cooling off in the water. Of course, I wouldn’t miss an opportunity to snap a few photos to share with you all.</nbsp>

<nbsp>  
[![](jekyll_uploads/2011/08/chocolate-pie-quesadilla-bruschetta-lake-113-575x368.jpg "The Lake")](http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/08/end-of-summerstart-of-school/chocolate-pie-quesadilla-bruschetta-lake-113/)</nbsp>

<p>Suffice to say, I think our little excursion was just what we needed to rejuvenate our souls as we prepare to buckle down for another fall semester. I hope you enjoy these pictures from our day at the lake.</p>

<p>Thank you all for your continued support and encouragement. Please be patient as I attempt to figure out a posting schedule that works with my new class schedule. And be sure to keep us in your thoughts and prayers and we attempt to finish these last few semesters strong.</p>

<p>A Birthday Wish: It’s my sister’s birthday today so I just wanted to take a second to wish her the very best birthday! She is my best friend and I would be absolutely lost without her. Kendra, I hope today you are surrounded by those you love and who love you. Sending you all my love today. Happy Birthday!<br />

    <p>There’s a fun little project moving through the blogging community which asks individuals to weed through their posts and rank them. Rank my posts!?! After choosing the best post for each of the 7 categories, the individual then tags more talented bloggers to continue the thread of “7 Links.”</p>

<p>Although I have found these posts entertaining, I have secretly been hoping no one would tag me because the thought of weeding through all of my posts and only being able to choose 7 seems overwhelming to me. However, thanks to Meghan at <a href="http://scratch-made-wife.blogspot.com/">Scratch-Made Wife</a>, I am now officially a part of the 7 Links community. Don’t worry Meghan, I forgive you. Please be sure to head on over to <a href="http://scratch-made-wife.blogspot.com/">Scratch-Made Wife</a> and show her some love.</p>

<p>Without further ado, here are my 7…</p>

<p><strong>MOST BEAUTIFUL POST:</strong> <a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/06/white-wedding-bridal-luncheon/">White Wedding Bridal Luncheon</a> or to stay in the food realm…<a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/07/mini-blueberry-pies/">Mini Blueberry Pies</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/07/mini-blueberry-pies/shrimp-pizza-blueberry-pie-042/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/06/shrimp-pizza-blueberry-pie-042-325x215.jpg" alt="" title="Mini Blueberry Pies" /></a></p>

<p>Along with the recipes at The Kitchen Curtains, I post a lot of pictures from working out at <a href="www.auntwillieswildflowers.com">Aunt Willies Wildflowers</a>. So, although this project mainly emphasizes food, I couldn’t resist including one of my all-time favorite bridal luncheon posts.</p>

<p>I also included the mini blueberry pies because I just LOVE the final two pictures I settled on for this one. They are by far my favorite food-related pictures so far.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/05/gyro-pizza/gyro-pizza-peach-and-rhubarb-pie-047/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/05/Gyro-Pizza-Peach-and-Rhubarb-pie-047-325x243.jpg" alt="" title="Gyro Pizza" /></a></p>

<nbsp>  
**MOST POPULAR POST:** [Gyro Pizza](http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/05/gyro-pizza/) I couldn’t decide whether to go off of my stats or off of responses. Since I love this pizza SO much, I chose responses. I have had numerous individuals email me their praises for this recipe. It’s so simple but still so delicious.</nbsp>

<p><strong>MOST CONTROVERSIAL POST:</strong> <a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/07/saturday-baked-eggs-market/">Ramekin Baked Eggs</a> I write about food, crafts, and flowers–to be honest there isn’t much controversy there. I decided, like most food-bloggers before me, to take a different spin. I chose these baked eggs as most controversial because I feel like everyone has some personal slant on the way they like their eggs, so trying something new could stir up some deeply-rooted convictions.<br />

<p><strong>MOST HELPFUL POST:</strong> <a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/how-to-hem-jeans/">How to Hem Jeans</a> This post was a no-brainer for me to choose. There are numerous ways to hem jeans and this one works. Really! I received many comments about how simple this hemming process was for the beginner seamstress.</p>

<nbsp>  
**SURPRISINGLY SUCCESSFUL POST:** [Frosted Banana Bars](http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/06/banana-bar-recipe/) I think the mere fact that they tasted great was the surprise. I love all things sweet and adding the frosting was more of a personal preference than what I thought others would enjoy. However, the feedback on this recipe was fabulous.</nbsp>

<p><strong>POST THAT DIDN”T GET THE ATTENTION IT DESERVED:</strong> <a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/02/honey-ginger-shrimp-with-rice/">Honey Ginger Shrimp with Rice</a> Granted, there is not a whole lot to this post, but it was one of my very first on The Kitchen Curtains and I was SO proud of it and my pictures but unfortunately received very little (no) feedback. <em>tear</em> Ok, I’m over it. Really.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/caribbean-shrimp-cups/food-094/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/food-094-325x243.jpg" alt="" title="Shrimp Cups" /></a><strong>POST I’M MOST PROUD OF:</strong> <a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/caribbean-shrimp-cups/">Caribbean Shrimp Cups</a> This was a very hard decision to make. I love all my posts and although I love seeing how much better they have become as we progress, I still love those first few that barely qualify as a real blog post. I also had a hard time because I feel as if the craft-related posts are some of the ones I am most proud of, like <a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/06/rosette-tote/">Rosette Tote</a> and <a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/05/15-minute-dress/">15-Minute Dress</a>. But in all matters food related, hands down the Caribbean Shrimp I most love. I love the idea, the photo, and the taste.</p>

<p>Now to pass along the 7 links love, if you have already been tagged I truly apologize.</p>

<p>Kira at <a href="http://www.kiranoblephotographyblog.com/">Kira Noble Photography</a> for her beautiful of everything from weddings to morning coffee.</p>

    <p>Living far away from home has never been our ideal situation. Although Jack and I have our rough days being so far away from home, time and time again we have have found comfort in our friends. One of these dear friends, Kristin Waite, received her very first teaching position this week. In May, Kristin graduated with a master’s degree in teaching and threw a fabulous “Teacher-themed” graduation party. I asked Kristin a few weeks ago to write a post about her party and I figured, in honor of her new job, this week would be most fitting to share it with you.</p>

<p>So without further ado, I give you the fabulous Kristin Waite…</p>

<p>“This Apples and Globe theme would make a great party for a teacher in any phase of life: graduation, wedding, baby, new job, or retirement.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/08/apples-and-globe-graduation-party/garden-pasta-farm-098-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/08/garden-pasta-farm-0981-575x362.jpg" alt="" title="Teacher Table" /></a></p>

<p>I planned this party to celebrate graduation with my friends and family that traveled to celebrate the occasion with me. Below are a few of the online places I found inspiration and what I finally settled on.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/08/apples-and-globe-graduation-party/20090811_pencilvase/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/08/20090811_PencilVase-129x150.jpg" alt="" title="PencilVase" /></a></p>

<p>This pencil vase from <a href="http://stacijbrown.blogspot.com/2011/05/quick-easy-teacher-gifts.html">Simply Staci</a> became one of the most expensive non-edible features of the party. Buying that many pencils begins to add up, but the upside is that teachers always need more pencils!<br />

<p>Bakerella the cake pop queen made these adorable <a href="http://www.bakerella.com/candy-apples/">apple cake pops</a>. I wanted to use them to decorate the cake. I therefore used toothpicks to dip them in the red candy coating.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/08/apples-and-globe-graduation-party/garden-pasta-farm-093/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/08/garden-pasta-farm-093-325x292.jpg" alt="" title="Notebook Cake" /></a></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.bakerella.com/fourteen-for-the-fourteenth/">cake recipe</a> I found on Bakerella. It just seemed too decadent not to attempt. It is a beautiful cake, while not being unapproachable to those who eat it. I saw the recipe and as I was thinking about the party theme, realized this would make a great notebook paper design if the stripes were blue and not brown. This became the central goal of the party: successfully complete this cake. I substituted white chocolate instead of chocolate in the glaze and added blue food coloring.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/08/apples-and-globe-graduation-party/garden-pasta-farm-100/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/08/garden-pasta-farm-100-97x150.jpg" alt="" title="Composition/Pencil Vase" /></a></p>

<p>Another idea I found was to use books as <a href="jekyll_uploads/2011/08/untitled-1.jpg">centerpieces</a>. You can use them to raise the height of vases or candles on a table. I used them here to raise jars of cookies to different levels. This allowed them to mimic the serving plates on the other side that created a stair step on the opposite side. It would be incredible to have many older books that would make a perfect neutral centerpiece, but I don’t have those type of books. In their place I used my favorite history and education books that have gotten me through my education thus far.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/08/apples-and-globe-graduation-party/garden-pasta-farm-101/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/08/garden-pasta-farm-101-325x333.jpg" alt="" title="Composition Title" /></a></p>

<p>One original idea was to decorate the cookie jars with composition notebook design. I used this <a href="http://www.fuzzimo.com/free-vector-notebook-papers-and-cover/">website</a> to create the labels that identified what type of cookies were on the cookie bar.</p>

<p>I used free maps that I had collected from rest stops over the years to decorate the walls and create <a href="http://www.folksy.com/items/1282881-Antique-Maps-Paper-Bunting">map bunting</a>. Never underestimate the free resources available in the brochure walls at rest stops. I know I never will.</p>

<p>I also borrowed globes from friends and checked a few out from the university library to decorate my home. Along with rest stop brochure walls, never underestimate the resources of area libraries.</p>

<p>I hope this encourages you to let your party ideas marinate for a while. It is the small inexpensive details that make the party.”</p>

    <p>One of our regular farm ladies, Jane Mullins, has kindly shared her sour cream pound cake at two farm workshops now. One taste is all I needed, I’ve been raving about the cake for months. It is very moist with subtle hints of almond. Seriously, SO amazing!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/08/almond-vanilla-pound-cake/beans-party-017/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/08/Beans-Party-017-575x397.jpg" alt="" title="Almond Vanilla Pound Cake" /></a></p>

<p>I made the pound cake this weekend for a going-away party and unfortunately was too cheap to buy a bottle of almond extract so my cake was nowhere near as delicious as Jane’s. All that to say, don’t be cheap like me! Spend the $3.</p>

<p>Since I don’t believe I could ever come up with a better tasting pound cake, Jane has graciously allowed me to post her recipe for you all. I hope you enjoy it as much as I have.</p>

<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>

<p>3 cups sifted All-purpose flour<br />
6 eggs<br />
1/4 teaspoon salt<br />
1 Tablespoon Vanilla<br />
1/4 teaspoon baking soda<br />
1 teaspoon Almond extract<br />
3 cups sugar<br />
8 ounces (1 cup) Dairy Sour Cream<br />
1 cup real butter</p>

<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>

<p>Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Grease and flour a 10-inch tube pan and set aside. Combine flour, salt, and baking soda in a large bowl. Set aside.</p>

<p>Cream sugar and butter with mixer until fluffy. Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in vanilla and almond extract. Alternately beat in flour mixture and sour cream, beginning and ending with flour (Don’t over beat).</p>

<p>Pour mix into prepared pan. Bake 1 hour 15 minutes, or until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. Cool 30 minutes in pan. Turn onto wire rack to cool completely. Eat alone or with berries and whipped cream. We used a Farmer’s Market raspberry sauce and whipped cream. Yum!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/08/almond-vanilla-pound-cake/beans-party-003/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/08/Beans-Party-003-575x381.jpg" alt="" title="Pound Cake" /></a></p>

<p>I didn’t have a tube pan like the one Jane used so instead I used my bundt cake silicone which is much more shallow. If you too have to use a more shallow pan be sure to reevaluate your timer setting. I only ended up cooking mine for 40 minutes instead of 1 hour 15 minutes.</p>

<p>This cake freezes well. Be sure to double wrap and thaw completely before serving. And, as always, enjoy!</p>

    <p>Last night Jack and I went grocery shopping. Or as many here refer to it, we went to “the grocery.” We are attempting to find a weekly meal plan for our upcoming semester. The goal is to prep healthy meals for two weeks at a time in order to eliminate the decision-making process from our busy schedules. Let’s face it, after a long day of work and school, the last thing we want to think about is cooking before we start in on homework. Last night, I prepped food for three hours. Sometimes being an adult is fun. Yes, you heard me…it was fun.</p>

<p>In the midst of prepping and cleaning, I discovered yet another banana bunch gone bad, and instead of tossing it, I decided to whip up a loaf of banana bread. Normally I stick with an old family recipe that is super moist and delicious but I did not have sour cream so, as usual, I made do with what I had on hand.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/08/the-best-banana-bread-recipe/banana-bread-007/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/08/Banana-Bread-007-575x381.jpg" alt="" title="Banana Bread" /></a></p>

<p>The finished result was spectacular. Seriously. Incredibly moist and light inside, dark and shiny on top. It was perfect. And now, I am sharing it with you. I hope yours turns out to be just as tasty.</p>

<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>

<p>5 very ripe bananas (mashed)<br />
1 cups sugar<br />
2 eggs<br />
1/2 cup shortening<br />
2 cups flour<br />
1 tsp vanilla<br />
1 tsp baking soda<br />
1/2 tsp. salt</p>

<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>

<p>Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Mash up your bananas and combine in a large bowl with sugar, eggs, shortening and vanilla. Be sure to mash up the shortening well so there are little-to-no clumps. Once combined mix in remaining dry ingredients. Butter your loaf pan. Pour mix into pan. Bake for 1 hour and 10 minutes or until toothpick comes out clean.</p>

<p><em>Tip:</em> I noticed the top of my bread starting to look pretty brown around 40 minutes. I immediately put foil over the top and it didn’t brown any more throughout the baking process. In fact, when I was finally able to pull it out of the oven, it was browned perfectly. I would recommend allowing the bread to cook for 30 minutes and then place foil over the top.</p>

<p>If you are worried about burning in the last 10 minutes and the bread seems so close to being done, pull it out early as it will continue to cook while the pan is hot.</p>

    <p>Thursday on the farm was the annual “Teapots &amp; Tablecloths” workshop with 15 lovely ladies who were bold enough to brave the humidity. Unfortunately, I left my memory card in Linda’s computer, so the new farm photos will have to wait until after the weekend to be posted.</p>

<p>I did manage to procure this butterfly photo from my day of cutting on Friday. This lovely butterfly and about 100 of his friends made cutting in the heat a bit more enjoyable. Maybe it was the heat, but I found myself apologizing profusely to the butterflies for stealing their flowers. I also found myself wishing that all bugs were butterflies.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/08/why-cant-all-bugs-be-butterflies/dsc_0129/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/08/DSC_0129-575x412.jpg" alt="" title="Butterfly" /></a></p>

<p>Although Linda may disagree with me, I feel like I have come a long way these past 2 years in my interactions with, reaction to, and knowledge of farm critters. I no longer scream like a 6-year-old girl when an unexpected banana spider makes its presence known. I also finally realized that…<br />
a.) buzzing does not necessarily equal bee<br />
b.) stinging is not a bee’s sole purpose.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/08/why-cant-all-bugs-be-butterflies/other-149-3/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/08/other-149-575x381.jpg" alt="" title="Spider" /></a></p>

<p>I have learned that the rustling noises in the field are, in fact, not the aliens from Signs. Although I’ve still never actually seen the devious rodent(s), so I suppose it’s still a possibility. Moving on…cows are good listeners and being able to distinguish between a snake and a black hose can be a tricky task (Hint: It’s a hose).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/08/why-cant-all-bugs-be-butterflies/other-160-3/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/08/other-160-575x308.jpg" alt="" title="Cows" /></a></p>

<p>I’ve learned that hornworms (see below) devour an entire tomato plant in 4 short hours. Although I found him on my porch and not on the farm, I thought this creepy crawler deserved a shout out as one of the many bugs I wish was a butterfly. Apparently there are two varieties, one for tomato plants and one for tobacco plants. They have a black “horn” out the back, grow to be about 4 inches, and appear suddenly to devour your plant in one day. Not my favorite garden guest.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/08/why-cant-all-bugs-be-butterflies/sandwich-pillows-small-flowers-028/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/08/sandwich-pillows-small-flowers-028-575x381.jpg" alt="" title="Hornworm" /></a></p>

<p>Last notes on farm critters…Tennessee mosquitoes are much more aggressive than Oregon mosquitoes. Dead wood should be kicked before picked up or you may quickly find your arm covered by ants. In the spring, don’t look up into the trees while under them or you’ll likely catch a gypsy moth larvae with your face.</p>

<p>And of course, butterflies are the best bugs!</p>

<p>I hope you’ve enjoyed my farm critter post and pictures. Be sure to check back soon for pictures from Thursday’s “Teapots &amp; Tablecloths.”</p>

    <p><em>This week I am welcoming back the talented Mary Jackson who recently updated you on <a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/06/google-recipes/">Google Recipes.</a> Today she is sharing a little bit about herself as well as a few reviews from cookbooks she has used throughout the years. I went ahead and included one of my own photos for you as well. Hope you enjoy!</em></p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/08/guest-post-cookbook-reviews/bedroom-cookbooks-068/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/08/bedroom-cookbooks-068-575x387.jpg" alt="" title="cookbooks" /></a></p>

<p>I am Mary Jackson, wife of John Jackson, Milligan Bible/Humanities professor and mother of two teenagers, Quincy, 16 years old and Grace, 13 years old. I fortunately have a job I love as the Research and Instruction Librarian at Milligan. I work 30 hours of the week most of the year, but take time off in the summers and during holidays. All of that would keep me pretty busy, but I am also the fellowship coordinator along with other responsibilities at my church, Hopwood Christian Church, and teach an online course several times a year.</p>

<p>My hobbies are reading, traveling, internet fun and for purposes of this blog, cooking and baking. I was raised by a mother trained in all the traditional home economic arts, culminating in a Masters’ degree. Most of my childhood, she worked as a registered dietician. In another era, I think my mother would have chosen more of a science oriented path. While completely lacking in creativity, my mother knew how to do lots of things involving cooking, sewing, and crafts. More importantly she was willing to try just about anything. If she didn’t know how to do something, she was more than willing to find out how and buy the supplies necessary to do it. My childhood had plenty of art supplies, cooking ingredients, and sewing materials.</p>

<p>I lack much artistic ability and I am, at best, a very basic seamstress—I can usually get 75% of a project completed before the pattern completely baffles me and I just don’t enjoy it. But what I love is baking and cooking. I also married a man with very few cooking skills, but who was very keen on learning. We now cook well together. He took a great interest in yeast products, which I don’t enjoy, and has become an excellent bread man.</p>

<p>Baking is my favorite activity and baking in large quantities is my specialty. To give you some idea of what I consider “normal”. I make treats (usually two-three choices of cookies, bars or muffins) on test days for my husband’s classes. He has 100+ students most fall semesters. Needless to say I have some standby large quantity recipes and a good work routine. I have also been cooking for church groups and potlucks for most of my adult life. I’d like to blog on recipes/tips/strategies on cooking for large groups and as the owner of a large collection of cookbooks, I’d like to review a few that I love…</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/08/guest-post-cookbook-reviews/bedroom-cookbooks-071/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/08/bedroom-cookbooks-071-325x334.jpg" alt="" title="cookbooks" /></a></p>

<p>Since I work with college students, I get invited to a lot of weddings. Shortly after one of this year’s crop of weddings, one new bride posted on FB asking for recipe suggestions and cooking advice. This got me to thinking about what cookbook I would give to a couple just starting out.</p>

<p>Two classics deserve a bit of discussion. Back when I got married, 28 years ago (oh, my!), the traditional book for all new brides was <a href="http://www.thejoykitchen.com/">The Joy of Cooking</a>. I still have mine. The book went through a number of editions, some better than others. I used to refer to it occasionally as it is packed with lots of useful information. But with the rise of the Internet and other newer cookbooks, it is no longer my book of choice. Many of the recipes now seem dated.</p>

<p>Another of my wedding gift cookbooks, was <a href="http://www.bhg.com/recipes/how-to/cooking-basics/a-little-lore-on-americas-no-1-cookbook/">The Better Homes and Garden New Cook Book</a> in the three ring binder. It is truly a cookbook with only a little additional information. I love several features of this book. The inside front and back covers have one of the best equivalency charts (1 lemon = 3 Tbsp juice) and emergency substitutes. Very handy and I still use them. I like the three ring binder as the book lays flat, but now after all these years and several big moves, the pages are starting to fall out and have gone missing.</p>

<p>However, the book that I have gifted to many people and the one we most, is Mark Bittman’s <a href="http://www.howtocookeverything.tv/">How to Cook Everything</a>. Bittman is a long time food writer for the New York Times. He just stopped writing his weekly column this year. We have both the original edition (falling apart) and the revised 10th Anniversary edition. I have given this as a gift to everyone from experienced cooks to beginners.</p>

<p>Most of the recipes are straightforward and use ingredients commonly found in U.S. grocery stores. If the ingredient is more exotic, he tells you and usually gives a more readily available alternative. What I enjoy most are his many ideas for how to change up ordinary foods. He includes snazzy boxes labeled: 19 Thirty-Second Ways to Jazz Up Plain Rice, 12 Alternative Toppings for Pasta, and lists over 20 ways to cook chicken cutlets. Who hasn’t looked at a package of chicken breasts in the fridge and hoped for some dinner inspiration? He provides basic information about fruits, vegetables, grains, and beans including buying, storing, preparing and best cooking methods.</p>

<p>My only criticism, and it is very minor, is the desserts section is weak. If you need a desserts cookbook, comment on this post or just keep reading as I’ll soon be submitting dessert reviews.</p>

    <p>This morning was a beautiful Saturday morning. It was one of those mornings that make all that waiting and wishing for the weekend to arrive, completely worthwhile. After setting my alarm for 8 a.m., in an effort not to sleep the day away, I woke up to enjoy a hot cup of java.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/07/saturday-baked-eggs-market/one-saturday-morning-060/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/07/One-Saturday-Morning-060-575x458.jpg" alt="" title="Cuppa Coffee" /></a></p>

<p>Contrary to popular belief, the best part of waking up is not always Folgers. In my case, it was Coffee Co. Tanzanian Peaberry. After a sip of java and a hot shower, I walked around the apartment in my very comfy, over-sized sweats.Next, I set to work making a breakfast treat for my Jakie as he slowly brushed the sleepy from his eyeballs. What was our special Saturday treat? Ramekin baked eggs. Yum!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/07/saturday-baked-eggs-market/one-saturday-morning-102/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/07/One-Saturday-Morning-102-575x381.jpg" alt="" title="Ramekin Baked Egg" /></a></p>

<p>Lately, I’ve seen numerous versions of baked and coddled eggs: Caprese, southwest, seafood, etc. I decided to throw together my own version. It’s nothing special, just my staple ingredients for the first attempt. I think next time I am going to go with a curried egg theme. Here’s what I did this morning:</p>

<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>

<p>2 tbsp butter<br />
6 basil leaves<br />
1 small tomato<br />
1/8 c onion (one slice down an onion, all rings)<br />
pinch of cheddar cheese<br />
2 tsp pepper<br />
dash of salt</p>

<p><strong>Directions:</strong></p>

<p>Butter 2 ramekins. Chop tomato, onion, and basil. Drop 1/2 of each ingredient into the bottom of ramekin, yes salt and pepper too.</p>

<p>Crack one egg (or two if you are really hungry) and drop into the ramekin. Sprinkle the remaining 1/2 of veggies, basil, and seasoning on top. Bake at 350 degrees for 8 minutes, then broil for 3 minutes.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/07/saturday-baked-eggs-market/one-saturday-morning-104/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/07/One-Saturday-Morning-104-575x381.jpg" alt="" title="All Gone" /></a></p>

<p>Carefully remove ramekins from the oven and enjoy! I read numerous articles that also added a hint of cream to the mix. I wanted to give it a shot but totally forgot. If you are brave, go ahead and give it a try. I’ll be sure to include cream next time and let you all know what it added.</p>

<p>Back to my Saturday morning…after enjoying a delicious ramekin baked egg, Jack and I decided to head to the Saturday market to visit Roy and Linda. Here is one of my favorites from the morning.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/07/saturday-baked-eggs-market/one-saturday-morning-121/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/07/One-Saturday-Morning-121-325x604.jpg" alt="" title="One Saturday Morning 121" /></a></p>

<p>More market pictures to come. I hope your Saturday was as splendid as mine. Happy weekend!</p>

    <p>There are two dishes that I tend to crave without warning, macaroni and cheese and sloppy joes. Luckily, both of these dishes can be quickly thrown together, even with the measly ingredients found in the dark barren wasteland I commonly refer to as my fridge.</p>

<p>Last week, following a particularly hot and muggy day on the farm, I haphazardly threw these ingredients together in the hopes of creating something spectacular. Both Jack and I were VERY happy with the finished result, especially considering how quickly this pulls together. It is oh so tasty! If you don’t have all of these ingredients, feel free to substitute (I always do). As long as there is ketchup and Worcestershire, I don’t think you can fail.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/07/this-and-that-sloppy-joes/mushrooms-wedding-zucchini-080/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/07/mushrooms-wedding-zucchini-080-575x381.jpg" alt="" title="mushrooms, wedding, zucchini 080" /></a></p>

<p>**<br />
Ingredients:**</p>

<p>2 tbsp butter<br />
2 tbsp Worcestershire<br />
1/4 medium onion<br />
1 tomato, diced<br />
1 small green bell pepper<br />
3 cloves minced garlic<br />
1/2 pound lean ground beef<br />
1 tbsp brown sugar<br />
1 tbsp steak seasoning<br />
salt and pepper to taste<br />
1/2 c. ketchup<br />
hamburger buns</p>

<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>

<p>Melt butter in a large skillet. Add meat, Worchestershire, and minced garlic. Cook on medium heat until beef is nearly cooked through. Stir occasionally. Add chopped onions, tomato and pepper. Let cook 5 minutes.</p>

<p>Add ketchup, brown sugar, salt, pepper, and steak seasoning. Let cook for 15-20 minutes stirring occasionally.</p>

<p>Grate Parmesan cheese on top and enjoy!</p>

This talented individual runs her very own photography business, with hubby, in the Salem, Oregon area (my home). I have known her since Jr. High and have seen her flourish into a gorgeous, successful, classy, Godly woman. I hold the deepest respect for her and am so excited to introduce you to her today. So, without further ado, here is Kira of <a href="http://www.kiranoblephotographyblog.com/">Kira Noble Photography</a>. After reading, be sure to head over to her <a href="http://www.kiranoblephotographyblog.com/">blog</a> and also check out her <a href="http://www.kiranoblephotography.com/">website</a> for some exquisite wedding, engagement, and family photographs.</em></p>

<p> <img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/07/bridalheadbandheader1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Hello! I am so excited to be guest blogging over here at The Kitchen Curtains! Here’s a little DIY project that I whipped up for my best friend Amy. She is getting married at the end of this month and I made a headband for her to wear during her wedding reception. She is planning on wearing a veil during the ceremony and then we’ll put this DIY headband in before she and the new hubby dance the night away. I didn’t spend a dime on this project because I happened to have all the materials on hand. That said, most of these items can be found at places like Joanns or Michaels. Okay, so here’s what you’ll need.</p>

<p><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/07/headbandwhatyouneed.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>1. A length of ribbon or lace that will fit around your head. (I cut the lace after measuring it to the nape of the neck. We are just going to use bobby pins to secure the ends into Amy’s hair instead of tying it off.)<br />
2. 7-8 small rectangular pieces of lace or fabric. I used scraps of swiss dot lace from a previous project.<br />
3. Package of pearl or clear beads.<br />
4. Needle and thread. Be sure to use thread that will match the color of the lace or fabric.<br />
5. Scissors</p>

<p><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/07/headband1-1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>1. I marked the spot on the headband where I wanted the flowers to go with a pin.</p>

<p><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/07/headband2.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>2. Next, I started making the small flowers for the headband. Start with one of the small rectangular strips.</p>

<p><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/07/headband3.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>3. Accordion fold the strip. (I usually only got 3-4 folds per strip, but that will vary depending on the length of your rectangular strips.)</p>

<p><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/07/headband4.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>4. Thread your needle and tie a knot at the end of thread. Then insert the need through the center of the folded piece of lace or fabric several times until it is secure. Do not tie off or cut the thread yet.</p>

<p><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/07/headband5.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>5. A pearl bead will serve as the center of the flower, so next thread the bead through the needle.</p>

<p><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/07/headband6.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>6. Let the bead rest in the center of the flower and run the needle and thread back through the lace several times until the bead is secure.</p>

<p><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/07/headband7.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>7. Then tie off the thread. Next cut around the edges of the flower to make them round. You can get creative with the cutting around the edges to yield different looking petals.</p>

<p><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/07/headband8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>8.  Next place the flower on the headband and secure it by running your needle and thread near the center of the flower several times.</p>

<p>After securing about 8 flowers to the headband, I filled in some of the space between flowers by sewing in pearl beads. There is no right or wrong in DIY land. That’s all folks! What do you think? Stay tuned for a close up photo of how this headband looked on Amy, and if you try this DIY out I’d love to see your end product!</p>

    <p>The past two weekends have been full of wedding frenzy. Two weekends ago, I helped out a friend by coordinating her special day and this past weekend, Kristin and I hosted a bridal luncheon for a sweet bride out at the farm. Linda was on a family vacation so it was up to us to plan the luncheon, cater, and put together the arrangements for the wedding. So, although busy, it has been a fun two weeks. I’m now thinking my nursing degree may be the financial backing for an event planning/flower arranging/catering hobby, if indeed you can call that a “hobby.” Now I just need some clients.</p>

<p>Anyways, back to the wedding…the ceremony was held at Munsey United Methodist Church, which has one of the most exquisite sanctuaries (see below). The bride was very laid back (which we always appreciate) and was happy to use whatever was blooming on the farm for the arrangements. Lucky for her, there are lots and lots of beautiful flowers blooming on the farm right now.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/07/munsey-wedding/mushrooms-wedding-zucchini-192/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/07/mushrooms-wedding-zucchini-192-575x356.jpg" alt="" title="Munsey Church" /></a></p>

<p>We tied shepherd’s hooks to the ends of the aisles with raffia and hung ball jars on each filled with a variety of wildflowers. The sanctuary is very large and to line every row with flowers, although exquisite, would have been very expensive. Instead, we adorned every other aisle for the first 10 rows. I was worried the flowers might get lost in the sanctuary but was pleasantly surprised with the finished result.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/07/munsey-wedding/mushrooms-wedding-zucchini-184/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/07/mushrooms-wedding-zucchini-184-575x381.jpg" alt="" title="Ball Jars and Shepherd's Hooks" /></a></p>

<p>Here’s a close-up of one of our ball jars for you.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/07/munsey-wedding/mushrooms-wedding-zucchini-181-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/07/mushrooms-wedding-zucchini-1811-575x381.jpg" alt="" title="Ball Jar and Shepherd's Hook" /></a></p>

<p>The front of the sanctuary has a set of stairs, followed by a choir loft and then a back altar area, all very intricate. In order to not have the main arrangements overshadowed, they had to be big, bold, and beautiful. I think we succeeded!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/07/munsey-wedding/mushrooms-wedding-zucchini-144-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/07/mushrooms-wedding-zucchini-1441-575x381.jpg" alt="" title="Main Arrangements" /></a></p>

<p>Here’s a close-up of the main arrangements. These are compiled of sunflowers, lisianthus, feathered black-eyed susans and various grasses.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/07/munsey-wedding/mushrooms-wedding-zucchini-131-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/07/mushrooms-wedding-zucchini-1311-325x489.jpg" alt="" title="Main Arrangement #1" /></a></p>

<p>At the bridal luncheon on Friday, I helped our bride, Anna, put together her bouquet. The final arrangement consisted of dahlias, zinnias, limelight hydrangeas, and lisianthus. The green collar around the outside is a bubby bush, which is also commonly referred to as either sweet shrub or carolina allspice.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/07/munsey-wedding/mushrooms-wedding-zucchini-145-1-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/07/mushrooms-wedding-zucchini-145-11-575x443.jpg" alt="" title="Bride's Bouquet" /></a></p>

<p>I also braided ribbon down the stem of her bouquet.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/07/munsey-wedding/mushrooms-wedding-zucchini-149/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/07/mushrooms-wedding-zucchini-149-325x489.jpg" alt="" title="Bride's Bouquet with Braided Ribbon" /></a></p>

<p>Kristin and I used lisianthus buds, frosted explosion, ivy leaves, and blue thistle to make a few varieties of boutonnieres.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/07/munsey-wedding/mushrooms-wedding-zucchini-119/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/07/mushrooms-wedding-zucchini-119-575x404.jpg" alt="" title="Groomsmen Bout" /></a></p>

<p>Ball Jar Arrangements:</p>

<p>Shasta Daisies, Dahlias, Green Zinnias, Pink Lisianthus</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/07/munsey-wedding/mushrooms-wedding-zucchini-162/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/07/mushrooms-wedding-zucchini-162-325x448.jpg" alt="" title="Shasta Daisies, Dahlias, Green Zinnias, PInk Lisianthus" /></a></p>

<p>Zinnias and Sunflowers</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/07/munsey-wedding/mushrooms-wedding-zucchini-173/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/07/mushrooms-wedding-zucchini-173-325x489.jpg" alt="" title="Zinnias and Sunflowers" /></a></p>

<p>Pink Zinnia, Lisianthus, Ageratum</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/07/munsey-wedding/mushrooms-wedding-zucchini-169/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/07/mushrooms-wedding-zucchini-169-325x459.jpg" alt="" title="Pink Zinnia, Lisianthus, Ageratum" /></a></p>

<p>This wedding was simple and elegant, a combination I love. As you can see, wedding or event flowers do not have to match to go together and be beautiful. You can mix a wide variety of flowers, fillers, and color and still end up with a unified presentation.</p>

<p>I hope these wedding pictures give you a bit of inspiration today. Happy arranging!</p>

    <p>Working in the Milligan College public relations office has given me the opportunity to test out various recipes on the hardworking individuals in my building. Luckily, they make it easy for me as a few days ago, a bag of squash and 3 very very large zucchinis were left on the back table for whomever wanted to take them. I, of course, couldn’t pass up the opportunity and decided to try my luck at baking my first batch of zucchini bread.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/07/crumble-top-zucchini-bread/mushrooms-wedding-zucchini-051/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/07/mushrooms-wedding-zucchini-051-575x304.jpg" alt="" title="mushrooms, wedding, zucchini 051" /></a></p>

<p>After perusing 30-or-so zucchini bread recipes, and realizing I could not, in fact, choose just one, I instead decided to combine a few recipes and techniques for my very own version of zucchini bread.</p>

<p>The finished result was very moist and sweet (would you expect anything else?). I am in love! This recipe makes 2 loaves of bread. The zucchini was so large I only ended up using half of it to get my 3 cups worth of shredded zucchini. However, I believe 2 normal-sized zucchinis should be enough for you.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/07/crumble-top-zucchini-bread/mushrooms-wedding-zucchini-044/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/07/mushrooms-wedding-zucchini-044-575x396.jpg" alt="" title="mushrooms, wedding, zucchini 044" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Bread Ingredients:</strong></p>

<p>3 eggs<br />
1/2 c. applesauce<br />
1/2 c. vegetable oil<br />
dash of nutmeg<br />
3 cups flour<br />
2 cups white sugar<br />
3 cups grated zucchini<br />
2 tsp. vanilla extract<br />
3 tsp. ground cinnamon<br />
1/4 tsp. baking powder<br />
1 tsp. baking soda<br />
1/2 tsp. salt</p>

<p><strong>Crumble Topping:</strong></p>

<p>4 tbsp. butter (melted)<br />
3/4 c. flour<br />
3/4 c. brown sugar</p>

<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>

<p>Preheat oven to 325 degrees.</p>

<p>Grease 2 bread loaf pans. I also sprinkled flour in the bottom of mine to help keep it from sticking.</p>

<p>Whisk eggs until frothy. Add in sugar, vanilla, applesauce, and oil. Combine well. Add in 1/2 of the flour mixture, baking powder, salt, baking soda, cinnamon and nutmeg.</p>

<p>Grate zucchini and add to mixture. Add remaining flour. Mix well. Pour mixture into 2 loaf pans.</p>

<p>Combine crumble topping ingredients well. You want the flour and sugar to kind of stick together into little granola-like clusters. Sprinkle on top of batter.</p>

<p>Place loafs into the oven for 60-70 minutes or until an inserted toothpick comes out clean.<br />
<em>Update: I received a comment recently about difficulty getting the center of the loaf to cook through. I’ve made this recipe a few times and it was always cooked through so I’m thinking it could be my oven which tends to run a bit hot. I’d recommend testing your loaf with a toothpick and adjusting the temperature and cook time accordingly. Thanks for the feedback!</em></p>

<p>Allow to cool and enjoy!</p>

    <p>Following a busy weekend as wedding coordinator in Mechanicsville, Virginia, I came home to find a wonderful surprise. After a long year of watching and waiting, and waiting and watching, and perhaps a little impatient complaining, Whitney Miller’s first ever cookbook finally arrived at my front door. Miller is the season 1 winner of MasterChef (summer 2010). Her new cookbook, “Modern Hospitality” has been one year in the making and is 172 pages long.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/07/cookbook-review/kellys-wedding-142/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/07/kellys-wedding-142-575x464.jpg" alt="" title="kellys wedding 142" /></a></p>

<p>In the past two years I have become quite obsessed with cooking shows, mainly those involving either Chef Curtis Stone or my all-time favorite, Gordon Ramsay. Last summer’s MasterChef became an instant favorite with the 22-year-old Southern underdog, Whitney Miller, rising to the forefront. I enjoyed watching Whitney create her dishes because she uses simple ingredients and simple techniques to create fabulous looking and I’m sure, fabulous tasting food. Although she is far more skilled than I am (and younger, I will now swallow my pride), I feel that our cooking methods and priorities are similar, therefore, I can’t wait to dive into her cookbook.</p>

<p>Whitney’s cookbook is a modern twist on Southern cooking and hospitality. She takes many of the “boring” and less-sought-after vegetables and somehow manages to glamorize them.</p>

<p>Some of my favorite recipes so far include a carrot souffle, cauliflower mac n’ cheese, upside down quiche, turnip green pesto, and pulled pork BBQ. She also gives a southern affogato recipe. Affogato is a type of ice cream dessert, usually in the form of a scoop of gelato with shots of espresso over the top. When I was living in Ukraine, this was one of my all-time favorite treats. Whitney’s version has a home-made butter pecan ice cream. Yummy!</p>

<p>If you can’t tell yet, I am so excited to dive into this great southern cookbook. So, off I go. I’ll be sure to update you all as I cook my way through Whitney’s recipes.</p>

    <p>Last summer I bought these cute little yellow glass lanterns at a thrift store for $2. I liked the yellow because it is summer color, but this yellow was too dark for my tastes. My solution? Spray paint. A few days ago, while going through my nightly routine of catching up on the 48 or so blogs I have bookmarked, I saw these lanterns that were painted with a glow-in-the-dark paint (which was awesome). I, however, couldn’t justify spending the money on glow in the dark paint for just one project. Instead, I chose an indoor/outdoor $.97 can of pure white, thinking by the time I put a candle inside it’ll glow all by itself. I know, I’m pretty clever like that.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/07/spray-paint-patio-lights/bracelet-tote-taco-lasagna-066/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/06/bracelet-tote-taco-lasagna-066-575x381.jpg" alt="" title="bracelet, tote, taco lasagna 066" /></a></p>

<p>Can I just say, that although these almost look like little milk jugs, I absolutely love the finished product. The paint has an almost marbled look with tiny hints of yellow showing through which give it lots of texture. I have the lanterns sitting in between my pepper plants at the moment just waiting for me to attach them to the our porch railing.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/07/spray-paint-patio-lights/bracelet-tote-taco-lasagna-068/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/06/bracelet-tote-taco-lasagna-068-575x865.jpg" alt="" title="bracelet, tote, taco lasagna 068" /></a></p>

<p>If you have old jars, tins, or frames that you think you will never display in your home, don’t discount the power a new coat of paint can make, turning old and grungy into new and modern.</p>

    <p>The Fourth of July is far from my favorite holiday. Can I say that without getting into trouble? I think it has something to do with having to stay up late to enjoy fireworks that only last about 10 minutes. I have never been a night owl, and I fear that the older I get, the earlier and earlier I hit the sack.</p>

<p>I have many wonderful memories from the fourth. I enjoy families gathering together, the variety of BBQ smells wafting through the neighborhood, my father lighting fireworks from on top of a ladder in order to give us more height (that’s my favorite). One more thing I love about the 4th of July, bountiful blueberries. I picked fresh blueberries once and the experience somehow sold me on the fruit. Blueberries are, simply put, a fun fruit. Small, blue, sweet and tart all at the same time. They can be used in salads, pies, and drinks. So much versatility. Seeing as I have an insatiable sweet tooth, this week I opted for the traditional blueberry pie, in mini form.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/07/mini-blueberry-pies/miniblueberrypie-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/07/miniblueberrypie-2-575x382.jpg" alt="mini blueberry pie" title="miniblueberrypie (2)" /></a></p>

<p>For this recipe, I simply threw in a mixture of powders and sugars hoping the proportions were right. I think you will agree, the finished result was exceptional. I also finally found the perfect ramekins for me at World Market (yes, I am a picky ramekin shopper). They’re blue and I’m in love! I was so excited to fill them with mini blueberry pies that I couldn’t even wait until the 4th.</p>

<p><em>Filling Ingredients:</em></p>

<p>1 pint fresh blueberries<br />
1/3 c. flour<br />
3/4 c. white sugar<br />
1 tbsp. brown sugar<br />
1 tbsp. lemon<br />
1 egg<br />
1 tbsp. vanilla<br />
1 tbsp. cinnamon<br />
1/4 stick of butter</p>

<p><em>Crust Ingredients:</em></p>

<p>2 c. flour<br />
2/3 c. shortening<br />
7 tbsp. water<br />
1/2 tsp. salt</p>

<p><em>Instructions:</em></p>

<p>Wash blueberries and let drip dry while you make your pie crust.</p>

<p>Mix flour, salt and shortening by hand. I use a fork to press the shortening into the flour to make it crumbly. Once the mixture is crumbly, add in the water 1 tbsp. at a time.</p>

<p>Roll out the dough and 4 circles 1-1/2 times the size of your ramekin as well as 4 circles that just fit the size of your ramekins.</p>

<p>In a large bowl, mix blueberries, sugar, flour, cinnamon, and lemon. Let sit for 10 minutes so the blueberry juices absorb the sugar.</p>

<p>Press large dough circles into the bottom of the ramekins. Scoop blueberry mixture into each dish. Cover the top of blueberries with 3-4 thin slices of butter. Cover with dough and twist edges into each other.</p>

<p>Bake at 400 degrees for 20 minutes.</p>

<p>Pair with vanilla bean ice cream and enjoy!</p>

    <p>A gal can never have too many bags, at least that was my rationale for making this latest tote. Totes come in all shapes and sizes, patterns and colors, and of course price tags. Since the price tags are usually uncomfortably out of my price range, I choose to make my own after scrounging around in the $2 bin at the fabric store.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/06/rosette-tote/bracelet-tote-taco-lasagna-078-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/06/bracelet-tote-taco-lasagna-0781-575x381.jpg" alt="" title="bracelet, tote, taco lasagna 078" /></a></p>

<p>My first bag-sewing attempt was a diaper bag from Make Baby Stuff.com. You can find the original tutorial <a href="http://www.make-baby-stuff.com/free-diaper-bag-pattern.html">here</a>. This tutorial is extremely easy to follow, even if you are a beginner.</p>

<p>After my first successful diaper bag, I began to draw my own patterns in order to make different shaped purses and totes with a variety of pocket combinations. The instructions in the link can be used for pretty much any type of bag combination you can think up.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/06/rosette-tote/bracelet-tote-taco-lasagna-077-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/06/bracelet-tote-taco-lasagna-0771-575x381.jpg" alt="" title="bracelet, tote, taco lasagna 077" /></a></p>

<p>The rosettes I attached with hot glue. These are very simple to make. Cut a strip of fabric about 2 in. wide and 10 in. long. The actual size doesn’t really matter, the wider you cut the fabric the fatter your twist will be. The longer you cut the fabric, the more times you will be able to wrap it around itself.</p>

<p>Once the strip is cut, simply hold one end still while twisting at the other. With the fabric completely twisted, place it on a flat surface and start to wrap it around itself. Have sewing pins ready to hold the flower in place while you continue to wrap. Am I confusing you yet?</p>

<p>I’ll try to make a better rosette tutorial with pictures at a later date. Basically, once you have wrapped all of the twisted fabric around itself (so it looks like a rose), pin it, hot glue it onto another piece of fabric, cut around the edges and glue to your tote!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/06/rosette-tote/bracelet-tote-taco-lasagna-053-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/06/bracelet-tote-taco-lasagna-0531-575x381.jpg" alt="" title="bracelet, tote, taco lasagna 053" /></a></p>

<p>Here are the measurements I used minus the lining. The diaper bag tutorial gives more details with images if you need them.</p>

<p><strong>Fabric:</strong></p>

<p>4-15X21 (green, 2 for each side to reinforce)<br />
1-10X21 (pattern)<br />
2-5X21 strips (pattern for straps)<br />
1-8×23 strip (green for bottom)<br />
2-3×11 strips (purely decorative straps on the front pocket)</p>

<p>I didn’t have enough of the two colors of fabric to make a lining for this bag (yes, I suppose I could have used another color). Here is the order of my sewing:</p>

<p>1. fold over the top edge of pocket lining (the 21 in. side) and sew a 1/2 in. hem<br />
2. align pocket with the 2-15X21 pieces of fabric (I use 2 to reinforce the walls, making them more sturdy)<br />
3. pin the vanity strips of fabric over the pocket and sew each side down (that’s 4 lines of stitching through four pieces of fabric)<br />
4. pin this front piece to the two remaining 15X21 pieces (right sides facing in)<br />
5. sew up the 15 in. sides making sure to catch all pieces of fabric in the stitch<br />
6. pin the bottom piece to the bottom edges and sew (this one’s tricky, check out the tutorial)<br />
7. flip the tote right side out, fold over the top edges 1/2 in. and stitch<br />
8. fold strap fabric (5X21) in half (hotdog style) with wrong side facing out, sew along the long edge, turn right side out<br />
9. pin straps 5 in. from each side and sew in place</p>

    <p>Have you ever had that feeling of dread when you reach into the dark recesses of your cabinets only to find an empty space in place of that vital ingredient necessary for your meal? I had such a feeling a few weeks ago. Unfortunately, I did not discover the lacking ingredients (yes, multiple) until I was fully emerged in cooking the meal, already at the point of no return.</p>

<p>After a small mental tantrum, I pulled myself together and set to work finding and making substitutes.<br />
<a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/06/shrimp-creole-recipe/food-sweet-peas-table-133/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/06/food-sweet-peas-table-133-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="Shrimp Creole" /></a><br />
Here is the link to the <a href="http://www.skinnytaste.com/2011/03/shrimp-creole.html">original recipe</a>.</p>

<p>And here are the ingredients to our version, which, by the way, turned out to taste fantastic.</p>

<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>

<p>2 tsp olive oil<br />
1/2 cup yellow onion, chopped<br />
1/2 cup green bell pepper, chopped<br />
1/2 cup celery, chopped<br />
2 cloves of garlic, minced<br />
2 cups tomato sauce<br />
1 teaspoon of chili powder (I also sprinkled more haphazardly throughout the cooking process to our liking)<br />
1/2 tsp. salad supreme seasoning<br />
1 tbsp of all purpose flour<br />
2 tbsp water<br />
1/2 lb of large shrimp, peeled and deveined<br />
2 tsp Soy sauce<br />
1/4 jalapeno chopped finely<br />
3 green onions chopped<br />
2 tbsp parsley<br />
1 tsp oregano<br />
1 teaspoons salt<br />
1 teaspoons garlic powder<br />
2 teaspoons paprika<br />
1/2 tsp. pepper<br />
1 tbsp. lemon juice<br />
1 c. white rice</p>

<p>*I know that seems like a lot of seasoning but it was in lieu of the Cajun seasoning which includes all of those ingredients and a few more.</p>

<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>

<p>Begin by preparing your rice. Follow instructions on bag.</p>

<p>Heat olive oil on medium heat and add onion, bell pepper, celery, and minced garlic. Once the vegetables are tender, add tomato sauce, soy sauce, and all seasonings. Bring to a boil, cover and reduce to a low heat. Simmer 15-20 minutes.<br />
<a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/06/shrimp-creole-recipe/food-sweet-peas-table-118/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/06/food-sweet-peas-table-118-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="food, sweet peas, table 118" /></a><br />
Lightly season shrimp with garlic, paprika, chili powder, and lemon juice. Warm 1 tbsp of olive oil in a separate pan and cook shrimp. Add shrimp to sauce. Cook 5 minutes.<br />
<a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/06/shrimp-creole-recipe/food-sweet-peas-table-121/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/06/food-sweet-peas-table-121-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="food, sweet peas, table 121" /></a><br />
Mix flour and water and add to tomato mixture. Cook 5 more minutes.</p>

<p>Add chopped green onions. Taste, taste, taste! Adjust any seasonings necessary to fit your preference.</p>

<p>Serve over rice and enjoy!</p>

    <p>Jack and I flew out West (California) last week to help celebrate three momentous events: grandparents 50th wedding anniversary, aunt and uncle’s 25th anniversary, and uncle’s 50th birthday</p>

<p>In the middle of the party, the grandparents decided to surprise the guests by throwing a second wedding and renewing their vows. It was a beautiful day full of friends, family, and lots and lots of food.</p>

<div id="attachment_836" style="width: 585px" class="wp-caption alignleft">[![](jekyll_uploads/2011/06/cali-2011-076-575x431.jpg "paella closeup")](http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/06/parties-and-paella/cali-2011-076/)

Paella Closeup

</div>

<p>Other ingredients for this spectacular bash: 200 guests, 300 BBQ Oysters, 3 roasted pigs, 1 giant pan of paella, 4 bands,  and lots and lots of appetizers</p>

<p>I thought you all might enjoy pictures of the beautiful paella dish. For those of you who may not be familiar with this dish, I will attempt to explain.</p>

<p>Paella is a type of Spanish rice dish, associated with the region of Valencia. Paella can take on many forms with many different combinations of ingredients which may or may not contain the following:</p>

<p>chicken, pork, shellfish, fish, eel, squid, beans, peas, artichokes or peppers</p>

<p>The essential spice is saffron, which also turns the rice a golden color.</p>

<p>What I believe is most intriguing about paella is the way in which it must be cooked. Paella is cooked in a giant flat pan over an open fire. The meat is browned first on a higher heat and later reduced to simmer the rice.</p>

<p>Our paella included clams, sausage, chicken, rice, asparagus, red peppers, and much more.</p>

<div id="attachment_835" style="width: 585px" class="wp-caption alignleft">[![](jekyll_uploads/2011/06/cali-2011-075-575x431.jpg "Paella Pan")](http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/06/parties-and-paella/cali-2011-075/)

Large Paella Pan

<p>The final pictures are absolutely beautiful and reinforce my belief that beautiful looking food is the key to wonderful tasting food.</p>

    <p>While I desperately miss my Oregon home, family, and friends, there are many aspects of Tennessee life that I absolutely love.</p>

<p>For those of you unfamiliar with my rantings, allow me to clarify…</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Aspects I do not love:</span> tornadoes, golf ball sized hail, banana spiders, distance from home</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Aspects I love:</span> rolling hills, 4 distinct seasons, summer heat that sticks around for more than 4 days, insanely energetic football fans, new friends, and finally…</p>

<p>the southern sun rooms!</p>

<p>Since we currently rent a little apartment, the chances of me actually having one of these beautiful sun rooms in a state where I can enjoy it, are slim-to-none. However, I have been working hard to bring life and color to our tiny, yet well-loved porch.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/06/mosaic-patio-table/table-023/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/06/table-023-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="Finished Table with Myrtle" /></a></p>

<p>My latest project involves our patio table. Up until this spring, we were sporting some lovely lime green $5 fold-out chairs. However, we decided this was the year to really enjoy sitting out at night to watch the fireflies flicker so we bought two new chairs and a glass table.</p>

<p>This last week, I set to work turning our table into a glass mosaic, glass shards courtesy of my lovely friend and neighbor, Kristin.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/06/mosaic-patio-table/table-009/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/06/table-009-575x411.jpg" alt="" title="table closeup" /></a></p>

<p>I took this fabric (see below) and taped it underneath the glass so I would have an outline to follow. Then I simply filled in the outlines with various colors of glass, glued them down, and grouted in between.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/06/mosaic-patio-table/table-022/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/06/table-022-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="table fabric" /></a></p>

<p>It looks like a lot of white but half of the white sections are actually pearly so they shine different colors in the sun.</p>

<p>I also stapled the fabric around canvas frames and am hoping to make hooks on the porch railings to hang the frames in order to make the porch look more like an outdoor room this summer.</p>

<p>This project took me about 4 days to complete.</p>

    <p>This past Friday, I helped Linda host a beautiful bridal luncheon. The weather was fantastic, sitting in the mid-eighties and the flowers were absolutely exquisite.</p>

<p>The bride requested only white flowers for her big day and, in the end, decided to add a few splashes of green to the palette. We have never before catered to an all-white wedding at Aunt Willies Wildflowers but the combination of flowers turned out to be my favorite yet. So much so that I spent the entire day mentally redesigning my own wedding.</p>

<p>So, are you wondering which beautiful flowers we were able to work with?</p>

<p>As you can see from the following pictures, the finished bouquets were beautiful.</p>

<p>I would highly recommend this color scheme for those of you in the midst of planning your wedding. These flowers (except the lilies) are also relatively inexpensive to purchase.</p>

<p>I hope you’ve enjoyed these pictures from my day on the farm. Be sure to check out more flower images in the “Farm Photos” tab.</p>

    <p>These banana bars were absolutely delightful. I added a hint of rum to the batter and topped them off with rum frosting. Best of all, they are actually not too terrible of a calorie killer, sitting at about 130 calories per bar.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/06/banana-bar-recipe/food-sweet-peas-table-109/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/06/food-sweet-peas-table-109-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="food-sweet-peas-table-109" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Banana Bar Ingredients:</strong></p>

<p>3 tbsp. butter<br />
1-1/2 c. sugar<br />
2 eggs<br />
1/4 c. applesauce<br />
2 or 3 mashed ripe bananas<br />
2 tsp. rum<br />
1 tsp. vanilla<br />
2 c. flour<br />
1 tsp. baking soda<br />
pinch of salt</p>

<p><strong>Frosting Ingredient:</strong></p>

<p>1 stick of butter (1/2 c.)<br />
1-1.5 c. powdered sugar<br />
2-3 tbsp. rum</p>

<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>

<p>Preheat oven to 350 degrees.</p>

<p>Cream butter and sugar on low with an electric mixer. Add eggs one at a time. Mix in mashed ripe bananas (3 will make them more moist). Add remaining ingredients and blend well.</p>

<p>Pour batter into a large dish. These bars rise quite a bit. I used a 9×13. Bake for 20-25 minutes or until an inserted toothpick comes out clean.</p>

<p>For the frosting, barely soften the butter and blend with powdered sugar until the sugar binds to the butter. Add rum. If the consistency looks too runny, simply add more powdered sugar until the mixture is spreadable.</p>

<p>Once the bars are baked, let them cool completely before cutting and frosting.</p>

<p>Happy baking!</p>

    <p>Those of you who know me personally, know that my experiences living in Ukraine have made me a passionate supporter of international adoption. After working in Ukrainian orphanages for 9 months, I firmly believe adoption is somewhere in the Weinbender future.</p>

<p>Because of this belief, I am taking a break from my usual posts to help spread the word about the Chase family Summer Adoption Auction. Please head over to the <a href="http://teamchase4andcounting.blogspot.com/">Team Chase</a> blog to read their story and follow their journey as they raise money to adopt two little ones from Ethiopia.</p>

<p>Even if you choose not to buy anything from the auction, I think an encouraging word would go a long way as they move closer toward bringing home their Ethiopian children.</p>

<p>You can also purchase coffee that will go toward their adoption fund <a href="http://www.justlovecoffee.com/TeamChase">here</a>.</p>

    <p>On Memorial Day, we had a few of our close friends over for a little BBQ. The evening was enjoyable, filled with food, cornhole and a backstabbing game of phase10 twist. However, the evening was also a bit solemn as we said goodbye to two of our closest friends, Adam and Leslie Bean. A fabulous couple whom we feel privileged to have known these past 6 years. Adam was recently accepted to Johns Hopkins University so they will be moving to Baltimore after spending the summer at an archeological dig in Jordan.</p>

<p>I have never been good at saying goodbye to those I love. I usually end up awkwardly changing the subject. To this day I cringe when I remember my response to my favorite youth pastor of all time when he and his wife told me they were moving away…</p>

<p>“You’re moving? Well, you sure didn’t give us much time to throw you a going away party!” This is what I really wanted to say, “But, I love you! Why are you doing this to me! You can’t go!”</p>

<p>As you can see, I am definitely not one for goodbyes. So, what is my secret to dealing with them now? Cake!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/06/mocha-frosted-chocolate-cake/cake-017/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/06/cake-017-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="spikey cake!" /></a><br />
You can tell my degree of sadness by either the size of the cake or the amount of sugar added to it. I think the picture above should clue you in on how much we love the Beans.</p>

<p>This recipe is from the May issue of <em>Real Simple</em> magazine which had a section devoted to different cake, filling, and frosting combinations to mix and match.</p>

<p>This is what I came up with…</p>

<p>Mocha frosted double layer chocolate cake with white chocolate chips and chocolate shavings on top. If that doesn’t make saying goodbye easier, I don’t know what does.</p>

<p><strong>Chocolate Cake Ingredients:</strong></p>

<p>1 c. unsalted butter<br />
3/4 c. unsweetened cocoa powder<br />
2 c. all-purpose flour<br />
1 tsp. baking powder<br />
1 tsp. baking soda<br />
1 tsp. salt<br />
1-1/2 c. sugar<br />
2 tsp. vanilla<br />
3 eggs<br />
1-1/2 c. milk</p>

<p><strong>Chocolate Cake Instructions:</strong></p>

<p>Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Butter two circular pans, line with parchment paper, butter and sprinkle with cocoa powder.</p>

<p>Mix butter and sugar on high until fluffy. Add vanilla and eggs. On low, slowly add flour, then milk, flour, then milk, until all ingredients are mixed together. Pour batter into pans and bake until toothpick comes out clean.</p>

<p>I used two 9-inch round pans and baked them for 30 minutes. Let the cake cool completely before trying to remove from the pan.</p>

<p><strong>Coffee Frosting Ingredients:</strong></p>

<p>1 tbsp. instant coffee powder<br />
1 tbsp. hot water<br />
2 c. butter<br />
1 lb. powdered sugar<br />
1 tsp. vanilla extract</p>

<p><strong>Coffee Frosting Instructions:</strong></p>

<p>Combine instant coffee powder and water. Stir until powder is completely dissolved. Set aside. In a large bowl, mix butter on high until fluffy. Slowly add sugar, coffee mixture, and vanilla. Mix on low until smooth.</p>

<p>I ended up adding a second 1/2 batch of the coffee mixture to my icing (because I really like coffee), if you do this you must also add a little bit more powdered sugar or your icing will be too runny.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/06/mocha-frosted-chocolate-cake/cake-024/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/06/cake-024-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="slice" /></a><br />
<strong>Frosting Tips:</strong></p>

<p>1. Frost the top of the first layer, then stack the layers.<br />
2. Frost the top of the cake before moving to the sides.<br />
3. Allow the icing to firm in the fridge before adding toppings.</p>

<p>I hope your cake tastes as delicious as ours did. Happy baking!</p>

    <p><em>A guest post from a very talented individual Jack and I have had the pleasure of getting to know over the past 2 years. I love this new feature on Google. If you haven’t tried it yet, give it a shot. It is fabulous!</em></p>

<p>I am Mary Jackson, friend of Tiffany and co-worker (and friend) of Jack. I was talking with Tiffany about a blog post I was writing for the Milligan library blog that related to cooking. Tiffany suggested that it might be a good choice for her blog (which I love).</p>

<p>This spring Google launched a new feature, Google Recipes. I stumbled across it when I was craving lemon meringue pie. I did a regular Google search for lemon meringue pie, then realized while scanning the recipes that I didn’t have a required ingredient, cream of tartar. I went back to revise my search and what did I see:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/06/google-recipes/google-pie/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/06/google-pie-575x465.png" alt="" title="google pie" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xq4SBaMHOpU/TeesWcvMsjI/AAAAAAAAAoA/bXCgPm-f8ng/s1600/google+pie.PNG"></a>I could now filter my results: by ingredients that I did (or did not) have, by cook time and by calories. WOW! I quickly clicked the NO box next to cream of tartar and instantly I had a new list of recipes that did not require me to make a trip to the store. The best part is you don’t have to do anything. If you type search terms into the regular Google search box and it yields results including recipes, the recipe features automatically pops up on the left hand side of the results. I love it! And the lemon meringue pie made without cream of tartar? Delicious.</p>

    <p>I think David Dundas’ song “Jeans On” pretty much sums up my attitude toward blue jeans. If you have only heard the Keith Urban version please go to this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWdcZqG02Ls">link</a> and listen to the original before reading further.</p>

<p><em>“When I wake up in the mornin’ light</em><br />
<em>I pull on my jeans and I feel all right</em><br />
<em>I pull my blue jeans on</em><br />
<em>I pull my old blue jeans on (cha-cha)</em><br />
<em>I pull my blue jeans on</em><br />
<em>I pull my old blue jeans on (cha-cha)”</em></p>

<p>It isn’t because the lyrics are all about the greatness of jeans (because they’re not) however, the melody of this song is exactly how I feel when I pull my blue jeans on.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/05/my-blue-jeans/jeans1/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/05/jeans1-325x253.jpg" alt="" title="jeans1" /></a></p>

<p>When I wake up in the mornin’ light, pulling on my jeans <strong>really does</strong> make me feel alright. Cha-Cha!</p>

<p>This post was actually inspired by a post I read a few days ago at <a href="http://www.dana-made-it.com/2011/05/what-i-wear-everyday.html">Made</a> (I must admit, her post is much more amusing then mine), which showed images of her wardrobe consisting only of T-shirts and jeans in various colors.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/05/my-blue-jeans/jeans3/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/05/jeans3-575x186.jpg" alt="" title="jeans3" /></a></p>

<p>If you are an avid blogger, or at least an avid reader of blogs, I’m sure you have run across the vast array of “style” posts. These are the posts that make you feel incredibly guilty for not looking like a size 0 model in $700 jeans every day of the week. The featured outfits usually include a few of the following: high-heeled boots, peasant blouse, vintage blazer, bedazzling jewelry, skinny jeans, large belts, leather hand bag, lots of makeup, and so on.</p>

<p>As much as I may like these featured outfits, I am the Queen of Practicality. It’s true. Just ask my mother who sends me birthday money with a note saying, “do not use for bills.” So, what does this practical girl buy every single time she reluctantly changes out of her sweatpants to run to the mall?</p>

<p>T-shirts and Jeans.</p>

<p>Now, I’m sure you are thinking, “that’s not a big deal, I wear lots of T-shirts and jeans.” My reply, “you ain’t seen nothin’ yet.”</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/05/my-blue-jeans/jeans4/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/05/jeans4-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="jeans4" /></a></p>

<p>The pictures I’ve included are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">just a few</span> of the T-shirts and jeans that I currently own. The picture above features 10 pairs of jeans (2 are skirts), and 10 t-shirts/tanks. I have 6 more jean varieties in the closet and many more T’s, not to mention all my Milligan t-shirt attire (2 drawers full).</p>

<p>Although the amount of jeans and t-shirts does seem to go against my previous statement of being practical, I do actually wear them all, all the time. That is more than I can say for the few dressier items I own. And, since I’ve pretty much been the same size since 8th grade, my jean collection is 9 years in the making. So, it’s maybe only half as bad as it seems.</p>

<p>Do I ever dress up? Of course, I actually enjoy dressing up from time to time and I DO own a few dressier items, but jeans and t-shirts are the majority by far.</p>

<p><em>A Pros list for practical me:</em></p>

<ol>
  <li>All of my jeans can be paired with all of my t-shirts. Talk about versatility and easy dressing.</li>
  <li>Dress them up with heels, a jacket, and jewelry.</li>
  <li>Dress down with flip-flops and a cute headband.</li>
  <li>For cooler days, pair your t-shirt with a sweater and throw a pair of rain boots on over your jeans.</li>
  <li>For warmer days, pull out the jean capris or skirt and a pair of flip-flops to keep you cool.</li>
</ol>

<p>See, now the next time you are staring dazed and confused into the wreckage you once knew as a closet, just throw on your favorite pair of jeans and a t-shirt, thus allowing for more time to enjoy a cup of coffee, or actually eat breakfast.</p>

    <p>It is not uncommon to find myself at a complete loss in the kitchen. Every few weeks I feel as if I have hit a cooking rut. There are only so many different ways to combine the same 7 ingredients. I know the simple solution is to incorporate more ingredients, but every time I find myself at the breaking point, another idea comes along. This time, my lovely husband provided the idea, a Gyro pizza.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/05/gyro-pizza/gyro-pizza-peach-and-rhubarb-pie-047/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/05/Gyro-Pizza-Peach-and-Rhubarb-pie-047-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="Gyro Pizza" /></a></p>

<p>You see, we kind of like Gyros. Actually, that is probably the understatement of the century. We kind of LOVE Gyros! More specifically, we love Ozzy’s Gyros in the mall. Not only are the gyros delicious, but we love Ozzy’s family. In fact, we rarely go to the mall for the actual mall, we just go for the gyros.</p>

<p>So, of course, the idea of a Gyro pizza sounded genius to me. Here’s what we did to make it happen.</p>

<p><strong>Dough Ingredients:</strong></p>

<p>2 tsp. dry yeast<br />
1 c. warm water<br />
2 c. flour<br />
2 tbsp. olive oil<br />
2 tsp. white sugar<br />
1 tsp. oregano<br />
1 tsp. garlic<br />
1/2 tsp. salt<br />
1/2 tsp. thyme<br />
1/2 tsp. basil</p>

<p><strong>Dough Instructions:</strong></p>

<p>Mix yeast in water and let sit until creamy, about 10 minutes. In another bowl, combine the rest of the ingredients and mix. Add in the creamy yeast mixture and blend until dough is firm and joined.</p>

<p>Cover the ball of dough and let sit until it doubles in size, roughly 30 minutes. Mine never doubles in size, but somehow Jake is able to make it work. Basically, if it doesn’t double, you’ll have a thinner crust. Since I love thin crust, I am ok with it.</p>

<p>Once the dough has risen, roll it out into the shape of your stone and get ready to bake.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/05/gyro-pizza/gyro-pizza-peach-and-rhubarb-pie-022/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/05/Gyro-Pizza-Peach-and-Rhubarb-pie-022-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="Gyro Pizza dough" /></a></p>

<p>Next, make my Greek sauce. This is very simple and is the same one we recently used on the Greek Turkey Burgers. <a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/05/greek-turkey-burgers/">You can view instructions here</a>. Once you’ve made the sauce, coat your dough generously. Why generously? Well, aside from more being better, this tends to soak into the crust a little bit so you want to start with a healthy amount.</p>

<p>We used ground Italian sausage for our meat, mostly because it is easy and you don’t have to season it. Just open the package and crumble bits over your pizza.</p>

<p>Jack and I wanted this to taste very Gyro-ish so we decided to add the traditional veggies after baking so it would taste fresh. However, I still love the smell of baking onions so…I went ahead and added 4 stalks of green onions to the pizza before popping it in the oven. I also added half of a package of feta cheese.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/05/gyro-pizza/gyro-pizza-peach-and-rhubarb-pie-035/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/05/Gyro-Pizza-Peach-and-Rhubarb-pie-035-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="Gyro Pizza-Peach and Rhubarb pie 035" /></a></p>

<p>Bake at 350 degrees for about 30 minutes.</p>

<p>Once, your pizza is done baking, pull it out of the oven (thank you Captain Obvious) and add your freshly chopped tomato, lettuce, and sweet onion.</p>

<p>Last step, enjoy your Gyro pizza. So good.</p>

    <p>Jack and I celebrated three years of marriage on Tuesday. Woohoo! Here’s a little tidbit about year three of marriage…apparently, leather is the gift of choice for three years of marriage because it is at this point the couple realizes the durability of their relationship. I don’t know if that is true or not, but I like the sound of it. I can hear you married veterans chuckling right now, “oh newlyweds.”</p>

<p>Anyways, I was able to take the entire day off for some much-needed R&amp;R. Poor Jack still had to go in for most of the day, but I was able to catch up on a bit of cleaning and partake in a few activities I’ve been missing.</p>

<p>So, what did I do today, you ask?</p>

<p>After waking up at the delightful time of 9:30, I lazily walked into my kitchen for a cup of coffee and was greeted by a beautiful lily plant and a very sweet card from my best friend and hubby. This particular lily had three blooming flowers, one for each year of marriage. Awww.</p>

<p>Next, I enjoyed a cup of coffee on our front porch and watched the morning haze wear away. Here’s a picture of our porch growing progress.</p>

<p>I then walked down to the mailbox and was blessed to find five anniversary cards from our friends and family. Thank you all for the well wishes. We wouldn’t be where we are today without your love and support.</p>

<p>After a tearful read over the cards. I headed to the bank and then our local Starbucks to get coffee #2, but more importantly, to say hello to my friend Jane.</p>

<p>After a brief visit, I made the trek down the block to Target for a little “window shopping,” or at least that’s what I told myself. Just look, don’t touch, don’t buy, just look. That didn’t last long.</p>

<p>I’ve been wanting a pair of boots for the farm since last summer. These were cheap and cute enough for me to finally cave.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/05/a-few-of-my-favorite-things/on-our-anniversary-2011-033/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/05/On-our-anniversary-2011-033-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="On our anniversary-2011 033" /></a></p>

<p>I mean, just look at these beauties, aren’t they perfect for a wildflower farm? I love boots!</p>

<p>I wasn’t completely selfish, however…I bought Jakie an individual mug/french press that he’s had his eye on for months.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/05/a-few-of-my-favorite-things/mug-006/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/05/mug-006-325x454.jpg" alt="" title="mug 006" /></a></p>

<p>We decided the one thing we absolutely wanted on our anniversary was sushi. So, we headed to our local Earth Fare and bought a few varieties of sushi, artisan bread, and Tillamook cheese. Yes, we bought sushi from a store, not a restaurant. Trust me their sushi beats any restaurant in the area.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/05/a-few-of-my-favorite-things/on-our-anniversary-2011-056/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/05/On-our-anniversary-2011-056-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="On our anniversary-2011 056" /></a></p>

<p>I thought Tillamook Cheese would be a treat as well since we can’t buy normal blocks of it like we do back home. In fact, half the amount of Tillamook cheese costs double the price here in Tennessee. So, it truly was a treat.</p>

<p>We also rented a movie we’ve wanted to see since February. You ready for this? Gnomeo and Juliet.It was SO cute and my kind of clever with remarks along the lines of, “What’s in a gnome?” Yes, I am easily entertained.</p>

<p>We followed dinner with another favorite, French Silk Pie from Dairy Queen.<br />
All in all, a very enjoyable anniversary, probably my favorite so far, and all for a reasonable price. Which, for practical me, feels wonderful.</p>

<p>A fabulous day of all the things I love: coffee, friends, gardening, sushi, Tillamook Cheese, boots, French Silk Pie, and of course, Jack. And now, I am finishing the day with one last favorite, blogging. So, thank you for indulging me as I take a break from the usual crafts and recipes to bring you a few of my favorite things.</p>

    <p>Today was a great day. Instead of the isolated thunderstorms the weather man called for, today’s forecast was bright and sunny. A much-needed reprieve from the past two weeks of dreary rain, although I’ll take the rain over tornado warnings any day.</p>

<p>Aside from the beautiful weather, Jack and I were able to partake in a day of celebrations as our friend Adam graduated from a 4-year-long Master of Divinity program. Yay Adam! He will soon be attending Johns Hopkins so, ya, you could say were pretty proud to know this guy.</p>

<p>Anyways, after a fun day of friends and mocha cake, I am going to try to crank out this recipe for you. Jack and I broke out the ground turkey Thursday evening to make one of our favorite meals, Greek turkey burgers. If you are one to criticize the authenticity of food origins than you might want to stop reading now as I have no idea if this can really be considered Greek at all.</p>

<p>However, we do use Greek yogurt to make the sauce, so that’s the name I am going with.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/05/greek-turkey-burgers/turkey-burger-and-dres-044/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/05/turkey-burger-and-dres-044-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="turkey burger and dres 044" /></a></p>

<p>We have made these numerous times and this last batch was the best yet.  Just goes to show, if at first you don’t succeed…well, you know the rest.</p>

<p><strong>Turkey Burger Ingredients:</strong></p>

<p>1 package ground turkey<br />
1/4 of a large sweet onion<br />
1/4 c. mushrooms ( I think I chopped 6 or 7 mushrooms)<br />
1/4 cup bread crumbs<br />
1 egg<br />
1 package of feta cheese<br />
1 tbsp Worcestershire<br />
salt/pepper<br />
oregano<br />
garlic powder</p>

<p><strong>Turkey Burger Instructions:</strong></p>

<p>Thaw turkey. Chop mushrooms and onions.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/05/greek-turkey-burgers/turkey-burger-and-dres-005/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/05/turkey-burger-and-dres-005-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="turkey burger and dres 005" /></a></p>

<p>Combine turkey, Worcestershire, onion, and mushrooms in a large bowl. Add egg and bread crumbs.</p>

<p>If you think the mixture looks super liquidy, you either need to mix it up some more (using your hands works best), or add a few more sprinkles of bread crumbs. I added less crumbs this time and the burgers ended up super moist, which was awesome.</p>

<p>Next, add 1/2 the feta package to the mix as well as seasonings. Be generous with the seasoning, really… you can never over-season. General seasoning guidelines??? I would say add at least 1 tbsp of oregano and garlic and 1 tsp of salt and pepper. The image below has all the seasonings on top of the meat, you should also have this much seasoning.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/05/greek-turkey-burgers/turkey-burger-and-dres-009/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/05/turkey-burger-and-dres-009-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="turkey burger and dres 009" /></a></p>

<p>Form mixture into patties. You should be able to get 4-6 patties depending on the size you prefer. Cook in a pan, not on the grill to prevent any slippage through the grate.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/05/greek-turkey-burgers/turkey-burger-and-dres-014/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/05/turkey-burger-and-dres-014-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="turkey burger and dres 014" /></a></p>

<p>At the same time, you should sautee some onions in olive oil to add to the top of the burger. Trust me, it’s the right choice.</p>

<p>Now to the Greek sauce…</p>

<p><strong>Greek Sauce Ingredients:</strong></p>

<p>1 single container of Plain Greek Yogurt (in the size that costs $1)<br />
1/4 grated cucumber<br />
2 tsp. pepper<br />
1 tbsp dill<br />
1 tbsp olive oil<br />
1-2 tbsp lemon (tast it after 1 to see what you think)<br />
1-2 tsp. garlic</p>

<p><strong>Greek Sauce Instructions:</strong></p>

<p>Grate the cucumber, yes, like on a cheese grater. The end product will look something like this…</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/05/greek-turkey-burgers/turkey-burger-and-dres-019/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/05/turkey-burger-and-dres-019-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="turkey burger and dres 019" /></a></p>

<p>Combine all ingredients.Taste it as you go, you may not like as much seasoning as we do or you may want more. Either way, these amounts should be a good starting point.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/05/greek-turkey-burgers/turkey-burger-and-dres-021/"></a><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/05/greek-turkey-burgers/turkey-burger-and-dres-032/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/05/turkey-burger-and-dres-032-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="turkey burger and dres 032" /></a></p>

<p>All that’s left is to place your burger on a bun, add sauteed onions, lettuce, Greek sauce, and voila, deliciousness on a bun!</p>

<p>These are fabulous, really, truly, fabulous. Happy cooking!</p>

    <p>So, I like clothes…a lot. Although I usually default to jeans and a fitted T-shirt, my fashion tastes did evolve while working at Nordstrom before Jack and I got engaged. Nordstrom clothes+discount=hooked.</p>

<p>Nowadays, being a young married couple, there isn’t much shopping taking place. Instead, I look at clothes online and dream of flowing cotton dresses, classic cardigans, and modest heels.</p>

<p>Every now and then, I see a dainty dress and think, “I can make that, no problem.” Unfortunately, it usually turns out to be a problem. I tend to overestimate my sewing abilities and let my impatience get the best of me, usually resulting in a less-than-satisfactory end product.</p>

<p>This time however, the end product was a success and it really only took me 15 minutes.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/05/15-minute-dress/turkey-burger-and-dres-055/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/05/turkey-burger-and-dres-055-325x433.jpg" alt="" title="turkey burger and dres 055" /></a></p>

<p>I chose this olive/purple stretchy fabric, it’s like a rayon spandex blend of some sort. First, I took two pieces of the fabric and placed right sides together. Then, I set a dress, that I love, on top of the fabric (see below) and placed pins in the fabric around the dress to copy the shape.</p>

<p>Next, I sewed 4 inches across the top for the shoulders, not sewing all the way to the edge. Then I measured down about 6 inches (the dress I copied had wide arm holes) and started sewing from that point down to the bottom of the fabric following the line of pins. I got the idea for the simple sewing on the shoulders and sides from this <a href="http://treyandlucy.blogspot.com/2010/06/if-i-had-baby-girl.html">baby hankie dress</a> which explains the setup more precisely sorry forgot to take pictures of the setup).</p>

<p>Finally, I turned the dress inside out and added a cute belt and some matching shoes. Tada! A dress I can actually wear (excuse the headless pictures, it was late and I have no desire to have my picture taken). I still have to hem the bottom, but I wanted to get the pictures up. Want to try your hand at sewing an outfit? Trust me this is the simplest outfit ever ever. You CAN do this. Happy sewing!</p>

    <p>One of my favorite guilty pleasures growing up included a tub of peanut butter, a jar of jelly, and a spoon.  Yes, I realize this is ridiculously unhealthy but how can you resist? Luckily, my peanut butter cravings have diminished enough for my husband to not be completely disgusted by me, however these tiny treats take me back to my love affair with peanut butter.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/05/chocolate-covered-peanut-butter-balls/catering-051/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/05/Catering-051-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="Catering 051" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>

<p>1 lb. powdered sugar<br />
1/2 c. butter<br />
2 c. peanut butter (smooth or chunky)<br />
1 package of dipping chocolate (almond bark brand works well)</p>

<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>

<p>Blend peanut butter and butter with mixer. Add powdered sugar.<br />
If you use smooth peanut butter try adding corn flakes to the mix and taking out a little bit of powdered sugar. This gives you a more subtle crunch than you would get with crunchy peanut butter and it just happens to be my favorite way to eat peanut butter balls.</p>

<p>Shape dough into 1-1.5 inch balls and place on a cookie sheet.</p>

<p>Ok, this next step is IMPORTANT…once all the balls are rolled place the sheet in the fridge for at least 30 minutes. The peanut butter must be firm before coating with chocolate or they will fall apart.</p>

<p>Melt dipping chocolate in a double boiler. You can microwave if your chocolate allows but read the directions carefully.</p>

<p>I do not own a double boiler so instead, I put a glass bowl on top of a pot of boiling water to melt the chocolate. This works well, but be sure the two are a good fit. You want to avoid letting out steam that will get into your chocolate and cause bubbles.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/05/chocolate-covered-peanut-butter-balls/christmas-pics-048/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/05/Christmas-Pics-048-325x433.jpg" alt="" title="Christmas Pics 048" /></a></p>

<p>Next, drop a couple of peanut butter balls into the chocolate at a time, use two spoons to move the peanut butter balls around until coated. Carefully drop onto wax paper and let cool.</p>

<p>I know that seems like a lot of writing to explain this process but it’s really very simple, waiting to eat the finished product is the hardest part. Enjoy!</p>

    <p>I made these tasty pecan tarts this weekend, recipe courtesy of momma Mary, for the Chamber Youth Leadership graduation reception at Milligan. These mini tarts are quick and easy to make, not to mention they taste phenomenal. Great for any shower or large get-together.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/05/pecan-tarts/lots-of-projects-124/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/05/Lots-of-projects-124-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="Lots of projects 124" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Shell:</strong><br />
1/2 c. butter<br />
3 oz. cream cheese<br />
1 c. flour<br />
Pecan Filling:<br />
2 tbsp. butter<br />
3/4 c. brown sugar<br />
2 tsp. vanilla<br />
1 egg<br />
1 c. chopped pecans</p>

<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>

<p>Starting with the shell, blend butter and cream cheese. Once blended, add flour and mix. Dough will be crumbly.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/05/pecan-tarts/lots-of-projects-088/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/05/Lots-of-projects-088-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="Lots of projects 088" /></a></p>

<p>Mix dough into 1.5 inch balls and place each in muffin slots on a mini muffin pan.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/05/pecan-tarts/lots-of-projects-112/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/05/Lots-of-projects-112-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="Lots of projects 112" /></a></p>

<p>Use a mini-tart shaper to press down in the middle of the dough, pushing the dough up along the sides of the pan.</p>

<p>If you do not have a tart shaper, like me, use the end of another tool from your vast array of cooking utensils. I used the blunt end of a pizza cutter.</p>

<p>I also flattened out the edges of my dough, pressing them into the side of the pan so there would be more room for filling.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/05/pecan-tarts/lots-of-projects-097/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/05/Lots-of-projects-097-325x433.jpg" alt="" title="Lots of projects 097" /></a></p>

<p>Now to the filling…</p>

<p>Mix all filling ingredients except the pecans with a blender.</p>

<p>Once ingredients are combined, pour in 1 c. of chopped pecans and mix with a spoon.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/05/pecan-tarts/lots-of-projects-106/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/05/Lots-of-projects-106-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="Lots of projects 106" /></a></p>

<p>Now, fill your tart shells with the filling. Fill only to the top edge of the shell.</p>

<p>Bake at 350 degrees for 20 minutes and voila! Mini pecan pies.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/05/pecan-tarts/lots-of-projects-107/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/05/Lots-of-projects-107-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="Lots of projects 107" /></a></p>

<p><em>A few tips:</em></p>

<ol>
  <li>You do not need to grease or spray your muffin pan prior to filling with dough. The butter in the dough keeps it from sticking.</li>
  <li>If you have trouble getting the pies out of the pan, use a thin piece of cardboard or a thick piece of paper to slide along the edges and it will pop right out.</li>
  <li>Dust the end of your dough-pressing tool with flour to keep it from sticking.</li>
  <li>Although small, these are fairly rich so you really do not need to make them any bigger than mini-muffin size.</li>
</ol>

<p>Happy baking!</p>

    <p>I love summer and I love Saturdays and today is both (at least summer break, even if the weather is still spring). I am currently sitting at my kitchen table, cookbooks haphazardly strewn about, coffee in hand, laptop playing Feist, and way too many baking supplies crowding the already crowded counter tops.</p>

<p>I always seem to have great expectations for my summers. You would think a break from all the classes and studying that normally consume my days would free up some time, however, that does not seem to be the case so far.</p>

<p>My list of things to do looks something like this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>finish Avynlea’s blanket before she arrives: Due date T-one month</li>
  <li>cut a sew 50 yards of fabric into table runners for Kelly’s wedding</li>
  <li>finish at least 1 of the 3 wardrobe transformation projects originally intended for the blog 2 months ago</li>
  <li>read the book Ellyn sent me</li>
  <li>practice my violin so I continue to shame my instructor</li>
  <li>fix the curtains in my kitchen</li>
  <li>make curtains for the spare room instead of the sloppy draped fabric that’s been there for 2 years now</li>
  <li>finish my picnic quilt</li>
</ol>

<p>The list goes on, but I think that gives you a good idea. Back to the point of this post…my boss asked if I would be interested in catering this Chamber Youth Leadership graduation ceremony on Monday. Because I love to bake, and can’t seem to turn down a challenge, I eagerly agreed. So, this weekend, my list will have to wait.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/05/my-first-catering-gig/catering-054/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/05/catering-054-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="catering 054" /></a></p>

<p>Here’s what I am making:</p>

<ul>
  <li>red velvet cake cookies with powdered sugar coating</li>
  <li>shortbread cookies with cream cheese frosting, sprinkled with cocoa powder</li>
  <li>pecan tassies (mini pecan pies)</li>
  <li>chocolate covered peanut butter balls</li>
  <li>homemade cheesecake layered brownies</li>
  <li>sparkling pineapple/orange punch</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/05/my-first-catering-gig/lots-of-projects-124-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/05/Lots-of-projects-1241-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="Lots of projects 124" /></a></p>

<p>So far this morning I have made red velvet cookies and pecan tassies. Included are a few pictures. You can find the red velvet cookie recipes <a href="http://www.bakerella.com/easy-and-easier-valentine-treats/">here</a>. The shortbread is basically the same recipes as my <a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/02/rummy-shortbread-cookies/" title="Rummy Shortbread Cookies">Rummy Shortbread Cookies</a>, minus the rum. I know, big disappointed sigh from my readers, but high school students and parents, I figured it’s better to not chance anyone being offended.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/05/my-first-catering-gig/lots-of-projects-084/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/05/Lots-of-projects-084-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="Lots of projects 084" /></a></p>

<p>I stole the pecan tassie and the peanut butter ball recipes from my mom-in-law. Thanks mom!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/05/my-first-catering-gig/catering-051-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/05/Catering-0511-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="Catering 051" /></a></p>

<p>I am freezing the juices from my punch into two flower-shaped rings for the punch bowls and putting my home-grown mint leaves into the mix. I think it will turn out very nicely (will post a picture here once it is frozen so keep checking back). I’ll be sure to post the pecan tassie and peanut butter ball recipes shortly for you all when my oven isn’t beeping at me. Have you ever catered an event for 75-100 individuals? Feel free to leave any tips you may have. Wish me luck!</p>

    <p>We have officially entered my favorite time of year, that time of year when there are more than 2 veggies in the store that both look and taste fresh. Maybe it’s just me but I’m pretty sure our meals taste 500 times better in the spring.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/05/bruschetta-baguettes/mint-tacos-muffins-bruschetta-042/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/05/mint-tacos-muffins-bruschetta-042-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="mint tacos, muffins, bruschetta 042" /></a></p>

<p>With summer just around the corner, Jack and I have started phasing out our heavier meals in exchange for lighter, more fresh versions of our favorites. Monday’s meal was fantastic! I made broiled bruschetta baguettes. This one is a must for the Weinbender recipe box.</p>

<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>

<p>1 baguette<br />
1/2 large tomato<br />
1/4 c. onion<br />
1/4 c. cucumber<br />
feta cheese<br />
graded cheddar cheese<br />
3 garlic cloves (minced)<br />
lettuce or spinach leaves<br />
2 tbsp olive oil<br />
pepper<br />
salt<br />
oregano<br />
basil</p>

<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>

<p>Slice the baguette lengthwise, so you separate the top from the bottom. Brush olive oil lightly over the tops of the bread. Mince garlic cloves and spread evenly over baguette.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/05/bruschetta-baguettes/mint-tacos-muffins-bruschetta-020/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/05/mint-tacos-muffins-bruschetta-020-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="mint tacos, muffins, bruschetta 020" /></a></p>

<p>Chop tomatoes, onions, and cucumbers. Place veggies on baguette. Lightly sprinkle with cheddar cheese. Sprinkle all seasonings according to your individual tastes.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/05/bruschetta-baguettes/mint-tacos-muffins-bruschetta-030/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/05/mint-tacos-muffins-bruschetta-030-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="mint tacos, muffins, bruschetta 030" /></a></p>

<p>Place baguette slices under broiler for about 10 minutes. Be sure to check every few minutes to make sure it doesn’t burn.</p>

<p>Chop a few slices of spinach or lettuce. Pull baguette out of oven when edges are browned. Sprinkle with lettuce and feta cheese.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/05/bruschetta-baguettes/mint-tacos-muffins-bruschetta-037/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/05/mint-tacos-muffins-bruschetta-037-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="mint tacos, muffins, bruschetta 037" /></a></p>

<p>I hope you enjoy it as much as we did. Happy broiling!</p>

    <p>Yesterday at the farm we had a Mother’s Day workshop which is one of my absolute favorite workshops each year. Mother’s day falls at the best time of the year for Linda’s flowers. The flowers are incredibly fragrant and absolutely gorgeous.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/05/flowers-for-mom/garden-pasta-farm-043-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/05/garden-pasta-farm-043-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="garden, pasta, farm 043" /></a></p>

<p>Some of my all-time favorites that bloom around this time include: ranunculus (the rose-like flower above), baptisia (the yellow stalk-like flower above), peonies, mock orange (my favorite), rhododendrons, spirea, smoke bush, and much more.</p>

<p>So, in honor of Mother’s Day, (and because pictures of the farm are my mother’s favorite posts) I decided to post some pictures of the beautiful flowers that all you mothers deserve to be given.</p>

<p>Happy Mother’s Day!</p>

    <p>I absolutely love shrimp. I could eat shrimp every single day and never tire of it. So, the other night, I decided to experiment with a make-shift shrimp soup. I was pleasantly surprised with the result. This recipe will feed 4 individuals 1 cup apiece.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/05/vegetable-shrimp-soup/shrimp-soup-and-tornadoes-017/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/05/shrimp-soup-and-tornadoes-017-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="shrimp soup and tornadoes 017" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>

<p>30 deveined shrimp without tail<br />
1/4 c. tomato sauce<br />
2 tomatoes<br />
2 green onions<br />
1/4 of a large cucumber<br />
1/4 c. red onion<br />
1 avocado<br />
1 leek<br />
1 tbsp. fresh cilantro<br />
1-2 tbsp. lime juice<br />
2 tsp. lemon juice<br />
1 tsp. pepper<br />
1 tsp. salt<br />
2 tsp. garlic</p>

<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>

<p>Thaw, rinse and drain shrimp. Place in frying pan to cook. Season with salt, pepper, and garlic. Add 1 tsp. lemon juice. Cook 2-3 minutes on each side.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/05/vegetable-shrimp-soup/shrimp-soup-and-tornadoes-011/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/05/shrimp-soup-and-tornadoes-011-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="shrimp soup and tornadoes 011" /></a></p>

<p>Chop cucumber, tomato, leeks, and onions and place in a pot on low with a small amount of butter.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/05/vegetable-shrimp-soup/shrimp-soup-and-tornadoes-007/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/05/shrimp-soup-and-tornadoes-007-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="shrimp soup and tornadoes 007" /></a></p>

<p>Add tomato sauce, lime, lemon, cilantro, 1 tbsp. garlic, salt and pepper.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/05/vegetable-shrimp-soup/shrimp-soup-and-tornadoes-008/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/05/shrimp-soup-and-tornadoes-008-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="shrimp soup and tornadoes 008" /></a></p>

<p>Add cooked shrimp to soup. Let cook for 5 minutes. Add avocado and serve.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/05/vegetable-shrimp-soup/shrimp-soup-and-tornadoes-021/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/05/shrimp-soup-and-tornadoes-021-575x461.jpg" alt="" title="shrimp soup and tornadoes 021" /></a></p>

<p>I also think this meal would work well cold or over rice. Don’t let the recipe limit your imagination, feel free to add to or take away from the ingredients, especially seasonings. I try to provide a general idea of how much seasoning I use but I normally season to taste, so taste your food as you go to make sure you like the finished product. Happy cooking!</p>

    <p>Grilling is one of the things I most look forward to about summer and this past weekend was perfect grilling weather.</p>

<p>Growing up, dad was always our designated grill master. I’d like to think I learned a few things from him throughout the years. However, I had never tried to grill the sweet potatoes before this past Saturday.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/04/grilled-vegetables/easter-017/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/04/easter-017-325x433.jpg" alt="" title="easter 017" /></a></p>

<p>Prior to living in the south, I had never eaten a sweet potato. I suppose you could argue that I must have tried yams at Thanksgiving or something to that effect, but I am convinced it never happened.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/04/grilled-vegetables/easter-021/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/04/easter-021-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="easter 021" /></a></p>

<p>In Tennessee, everyone eats sweet potatoes, also known as yams (although there is a difference between the two). Apparently, this root vegetable is some sort of nutrient super food, outranking all other vegetables in nutritional value in a 1992 study by the Center for Science in the Public Interest.</p>

<p>Anyways, all that to say, this weekend, we grilled our sweet potatoes and they were fantastic. We also grilled baby asparagus and zucchini (my all-time favorite grilled veggie).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/04/grilled-vegetables/easter-016/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/04/easter-016-575x519.jpg" alt="" title="easter 016" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Our simple and tasty grilling tips:</strong></p>

<p>Using a brush, lightly coat veggies with olive oil. Sprinkle with garlic and pepper.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/04/grilled-vegetables/easter-012/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/04/easter-012-575x506.jpg" alt="" title="easter 012" /></a></p>

<p>Grill until tender.I know… it’s super complicated, but simple always turns out the best.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/04/grilled-vegetables/easter-020/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/04/easter-020-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="easter 020" /></a></p>

<p>Another method for the zucchini is to coat with Italian dressing instead of olive oil, then sprinkle with garlic. Delicious!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/04/grilled-vegetables/easter-022/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/04/easter-022-325x433.jpg" alt="" title="easter 022" /></a></p>

<p>Best of luck with your grilling days to come. May it bring you and yours closer together this summer.</p>

    <p>Happy Easter! Seeing as we are so far away from home, Linda Doan, <a href="http://auntwillieswildflowers.com/" title="Aunt Willie's Wildflowers">Aunt Willies Wildflowers</a>, invited Jack and I to join in their Sunday afternoon celebrations.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/04/i-flung-the-tongue/easter-090/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/04/easter-090-575x408.jpg" alt="" title="easter 090" /></a></p>

<p>The Doans have become quite famous in our little neck of the woods for a variety of reasons. Linda taught at Milligan as the health and fitness professor, Roy (her hubby), retired from teaching mathematics at a local school. They own a farm, raise and sell cattle, grow and sell cut flowers, and volunteer their time and home every week.</p>

<p>However, what the Doans are perhaps most famous for is their much anticipated cow-tongue flinging.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/04/i-flung-the-tongue/easter-092/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/04/easter-092-325x433.jpg" alt="" title="easter 092" /></a></p>

<p>Yes, that’s right, today we flung the tongue.</p>

<p>Since Roy raises grass-fed beef, there are apparently a vast supply of cow tongues each year that the Doans are able to freeze and then thaw for various occasions.</p>

<p>The game concept is simple, throw or toss the tongue into a watering trough, moving farther back with each fling. If you miss, you’re out. Linda was today’s champ.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/04/i-flung-the-tongue/easter-076/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/04/easter-076-325x433.jpg" alt="" title="easter 076" /></a></p>

<p>I was a complete failure at the game. I’d like to say it was simply because IT WAS SO GROSS, but, if I am being honest, I should really blame my more-than-pathetic flinging abilities. As you can see in the following picture, Roy was less than satisfied with my “touch as little as possible” flinging method.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/04/i-flung-the-tongue/easter-070/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/04/easter-070-325x465.jpg" alt="" title="easter 070" /></a></p>

<p>I realize this post has almost nothing to do with crafts, but I thought you all would enjoy hearing about this unusual method of celebration.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/04/i-flung-the-tongue/easter-087/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/04/easter-087-575x564.jpg" alt="" title="easter 087" /></a></p>

<p>And, if you are disappointed in the irrelevance of this post,I hope you are able to at least appreciate the beautiful East Tennessee scenery. Happy Easter!</p>

    <p>Took out my good ol’ Betty Crocker cookbook the other night and threw together a combination of recipes that were oh so tasty. One part pound cake. One part coconut glaze.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/04/amaretto-coconut-pound-cake/crafts-and-cake-073/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/04/crafts-and-cake-073-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="crafts and cake 073" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Pound Cake Ingredients:</strong></p>

<p>2 1/2 c. sugar<br />
1 c. butter<br />
2 tbsp amaretto (my substitute for vanilla)<br />
5 eggs<br />
1 tsp baking powder<br />
1/4 tsp salt<br />
1 c. evaporated milk<br />
1/4 c. coconut flakes (only if you are also making the coconut topping)</p>

<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>

<p>Heat oven to 350 degrees. Grease bundt cake pan with shortening. Beat sugar, butter, vanilla, and eggs with electric mixer on low for 30 seconds. Beat on high for 5 minutes.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/04/amaretto-coconut-pound-cake/crafts-and-cake-040/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/04/crafts-and-cake-040-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="crafts and cake 040" /></a></p>

<p>Mix flour, baking powder, and salt in a second bowl. Beat flour mixture into sugar mixture on low speed alternating with evaporated milk. Add coconut. Pour mixture into pan.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/04/amaretto-coconut-pound-cake/crafts-and-cake-050/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/04/crafts-and-cake-050-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="crafts and cake 050" /></a></p>

<p>Bake for 50 minutes, until toothpick comes out clean. Let cool. Sprinkle with powdered sugar.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/04/amaretto-coconut-pound-cake/crafts-and-cake-060/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/04/crafts-and-cake-060-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="crafts and cake 060" /></a></p>

<p>Or add a topping of choice, like this…</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/04/amaretto-coconut-pound-cake/crafts-and-cake-072/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/04/crafts-and-cake-072-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="crafts and cake 072" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Amaretto Coconut Glaze Ingredients:</strong></p>

<p>1 c. sugar<br />
1/2 c. butter<br />
1 c. evaporated milk<br />
1 tbsp amaretto (my substitute for vanilla)<br />
3 egg yolks<br />
1 1/3 c. coconut flakes</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/04/amaretto-coconut-pound-cake/crafts-and-cake-052/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/04/crafts-and-cake-052-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="crafts and cake 052" /></a></p>

<p>Mix all ingredients minus coconut in a saucepan. Cook over medium heat for about 14 minutes, until consistency is semi-thick (like pureed soup). Add coconut flakes. Remove from heat and let cool about 30 minutes. Stir occasionally until consistency is spreadable.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/04/amaretto-coconut-pound-cake/crafts-and-cake-081/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/04/crafts-and-cake-081-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="crafts and cake 081" /></a></p>

<p>Apply liberally to top of cake and enjoy!</p>

    <p>My mom (momma Tammy) makes the best spaghetti sauce of all time. Even with the recipe, somehow mine is never quite as good as hers. Personally, I think the key to this yummy sauce is using ground Italian sausage instead of hamburger meat. The sausage is SO much more flavorful.</p>

<p>Despite my inability to recreate this sauce exactly, I thought I would share the recipe in the hopes of you making a sauce that is just as tasty. I have adjusted some of the ingredients to make the serving size for two.</p>

<p>Normally, momma Tammy dishes the sauce over spiral rotini noodles. If you are going to use noodles, you must use this kind. I don’t know why but it makes the dish so much better. You can also try my style, over garlic bread.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/04/momma-tammys-spaghetti-sauce/misc/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/04/misc-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="misc" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>

<p>1 package ground Italian sausage<br />
1 can stewed tomatoes<br />
1 can tomato sauce<br />
1/2 can tomato paste<br />
1/2 green pepper<br />
5-7 mushrooms sliced<br />
1/2 red onion chopped<br />
2 tbsp garlic powder<br />
2 tbsp oregano<br />
1 tbsp Italian seasoning<br />
1 tbsp pepper<br />
1 tsp salt<br />
1 loaf french bread<br />
Olive oil</p>

<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>

<p>Set oven to broil. Spread a thin amount of olive oil and sprinkle garlic powder and oregano over tops of slices. Place in oven about 5 minutes before sauce is completed.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/04/momma-tammys-spaghetti-sauce/misc-1/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/04/misc-1-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="misc-1" /></a></p>

<p>Chop all ingredients. Place Italian sausage in frying pan with 1/2 tbsp of olive oil. Cook until browned.</p>

<p>Add onions, peppers, and seasonings to meat. Cook for 5 minutes. Add stewed tomatoes after draining excess juice. Add tomato sauce (I like to buy one with some flavors added). Let simmer for 25 minutes. Stir occasionally.</p>

<p>If the sauce looks watery, add 1/2 can of tomato paste (mine varies with the type of sauce I buy).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/04/momma-tammys-spaghetti-sauce/misc-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/04/misc-2-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="misc-2" /></a></p>

<p>Once you have allowed time for the flavors to mix together, pull the bread out of the oven add sauce and enjoy!</p>

<p>A few tips for making Momma Tammy’s spaghetti sauce…</p>

<ol>
  <li>The longer you let it sit on the stove, the better it tastes. One thing I always thought was excessive was the amount of oregano and garlic she added. YOU CAN NEVER HAVE ENOUGH! Every time she went to stir the sauce, she added more oregano and more garlic. Trust me, this is the key to a spectacularly flavorful sauce.</li>
  <li>Watch your bread. Our family is notorious for making a delicious meal and then forgetting our bread in the last 5 minutes. We almost always end up fanning the smoke alarms. A sure-fire way to ruin the finishing touches of a great meal.</li>
</ol>

<p>Good luck and happy cooking!</p>

    <p>Milligan College holds an annual day off of classes every spring called “Wonderful Wednesday.” In the past, this event has also come to be called, “Terrific Tuesday” or “Marvelous Monday”. A welcomed reprieve from studying for finals, Wonderful Wednesday is always a surprise for both students and faculty.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/04/it-was-a-wonderful-wednesday/ww2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/04/WW2-575x383.jpg" alt="" title="WW2" /></a></p>

<p>This year’s theme was “Come Sail Away…” The Campus Activities Board is in charge of planning activities such as water sports, food-eating contests, and various competitions around campus for students to participate in.</p>

<p>A few of this year’s highlights included a giant waterslide, go-kart races, bungee-jumping, putt-putt course, ultimate frisbee, dodgeball and volleyball competitions and much more.</p>

<p>Seeing as Wednesdays are my main Public Relations work day, I had the pleasure of taking pictures all afternoon! I met with various press members who stopped by campus to take a few pictures for the local newspapers and then, I too, walked around in the beautiful sunshine snapping a few photos while simultaneously burning my shoulders.</p>

<p>Certain family members,you know who you are, are always asking me for photos so, I thought I would share a few of my favorites from our wonderful day. Enjoy!</p>

    <p>“So, I saw these shoes…”</p>

<p>Those are 5 little words that my husband hopes to hear as little as possible yet rarely does. I am usually a very practical person, however, when I saw the shoes pictured below it was love at first sight.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/04/sequin-shirt/rice-and-fanciness-092/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/04/Rice-and-Fanciness-092-575x359.jpg" alt="" title="Rice and Fanciness 092" /></a></p>

<p>Now comes the sad part, 4 months later, I still haven’t worn them. Why not? First of all, the college life is full of backpacks and trekking across campus through the rain, not exactly conducive to 3-inch heels. Second, I can’t find a fancy-schmancy ruffle shirt to wear with them. So, I attempted to make one.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/04/sequin-shirt/rice-and-fanciness-116/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/04/Rice-and-Fanciness-116-575x259.jpg" alt="" title="Rice and Fanciness 116" /></a></p>

<p>The picture above is the finished product. I was originally not going to add the sequins at the bottom (pictured below) and just let it be ruffly but I preferred the extra sparkle.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/04/sequin-shirt/rice-and-fanciness-044/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/04/Rice-and-Fanciness-044-325x576.jpg" alt="" title="Rice and Fanciness 044" /></a></p>

<p>I used this old tank from The Limited.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/04/sequin-shirt/rice-and-fanciness-023/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/04/Rice-and-Fanciness-023-575x486.jpg" alt="" title="Rice and Fanciness 023" /></a></p>

<p>And cut 15 pieces of red fabric to fill the middle section of the tank.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/04/sequin-shirt/rice-and-fanciness-025/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/04/Rice-and-Fanciness-025-325x321.jpg" alt="" title="Rice and Fanciness 025" /></a></p>

<p>Next, I folded each of the red pieces in half, lined them up side by side, and sewed across the top. Then I stitched the bottom edge. After the scraps were secured, I pinned the sequin strip over the stitching and sewed over the top.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/04/sequin-shirt/rice-and-fanciness-121/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/04/Rice-and-Fanciness-121-575x294.jpg" alt="" title="Rice and Fanciness 121" /></a></p>

<p>Yay! A sparkly shirt to go with my fancy shoes.</p>

<p>Dressing up a shirt is simple. If you don’t feel comfortable messing with both fabric and sequins, try sewing just one strip of sequins across a neckline or add a few simple, straight, sequin stripes across an old T-shirt.</p>

<p>So, pull out your favorite pair of impractical shoes, throw on your newly bedazzled shirt, and have fun!</p>

    <p>While there are many aspects of our little apartment that we love, one downside to apartment-living is the “no painting” rule. A consequence of having no color on the walls, I am forced to craft more in order to brighten up the place. Oh shucks.</p>

<p>I was going through a junk box last year and came across a package of potpourri. At first I thought I would be typical and arrange the potpourri in a vase with a candle, always a nice touch. Instead, I came up with this potpourri art.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/04/potpourri-frames/potpourri-017/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/04/potpourri-017-325x243.jpg" alt="" title="potpourri 017" /></a></p>

<p>Our couch is dark green so the limey-green fabric in these frames contrasts well and helps the walls pop with color. Potpourri tends to be muted colors so I definitely suggest picking a bright and bold color for the backdrop.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/04/potpourri-frames/potpourri-010/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/04/potpourri-010-325x243.jpg" alt="" title="potpourri 010" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Materials:</strong></p>

<p>3-8×10 frames<br />
6-5×6 pieces of fabric<br />
1-package of potpourri<br />
Tape or Hot glue</p>

<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>

<p>Overlap the frame backing with two pieces of fabric making the frayed edge visible (this adds dimension). Pull the fabric tight and tape or glue the fabric around the edge of the backing.</p>

<p>Next, scatter various pieces of potpourri over the fabric. I found that randomly dropping the pieces worked out much better than planned disarray.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/04/potpourri-frames/bread-and-potpurri-043/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/04/bread-and-potpurri-043-325x243.jpg" alt="" title="bread and potpurri 043" /></a></p>

<p>Carefully place the glass and frame over the top of your potpourri. If you are very particular about your placing, you can always use hot glue to make sure the potpourri stays in place as you attach the frame.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/04/potpourri-frames/bread-and-potpurri-046/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/04/bread-and-potpurri-046-325x250.jpg" alt="" title="bread and potpurri 046" /></a></p>

<p>Voila! You now have a unique piece of colorful art for your walls. There are lots of other materials you can use for a project like this so, as always, BE CREATIVE!</p>

<p>This morning I dragged my lazy bones out of bed at 6:30 and drove over to Grandview Christian Church, to help Linda set up for a workshop of sorts. Linda was guest speaking/teaching on the topic of flower ministries.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/04/early-morning-flowers/flowers-and-salad-035-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/04/flowers-and-salad-035-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="flowers and salad 035" /></a></p>

<p>As the go-to-flower gal around Grandview, Linda is well known around church, which is how I came to work on the farm with her.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/04/early-morning-flowers/flowers-and-salad-036/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/04/flowers-and-salad-036-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="flowers and salad 036" /></a></p>

<p>She faithfully donates her beautiful arrangements to Grandview services every week for all to enjoy.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/04/early-morning-flowers/flowers-and-salad-045/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/04/flowers-and-salad-045-325x433.jpg" alt="" title="flowers and salad 045" /></a></p>

<p>Flowers are a wonderful way to get involved at your local church. Don’t grow cut flowers? That’s ok! You would be amazed at the variety of arrangements you can make with tree branches, grasses, and even weeds.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/04/early-morning-flowers/flowers-and-salad-013/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/04/flowers-and-salad-013-325x433.jpg" alt="" title="flowers and salad 013" /></a></p>

<p>The pictures I’ve included are just a few from this morning’s workshop and should demonstrate how simple starting your own flower ministry could be. Enjoy!</p>

    <p>After an interview with the local newspaper, The Elizabethton Star, I was forced to answer questions I had previously never articulated. For instance… Why did I start this blog? What are my goals for the blog? What are my goals in life? How do I manage to fit crafting and cooking into my busy schedule? How do crafts tie into my nursing goals?</p>

<p>Since the interview, I have pondered these questions and realized perhaps you, my readers, would enjoy hearing the intent behind my creative endeavors.</p>

<p>Flowers:<br />
My mother would say I was a born “artist.” Ever since I was a toddler, I have had a fascination with nature. Mom tells me we used to go on walks where toddler me would stop at each little plant or flower we passed and gently inspect every last detail of it. I was captivated by this simple beauty.</p>

<p>Photography:<br />
Moving on to my junior high days, all I wanted was a “real” camera (a Pentax 35). I’m sure I drove my parents insane asking for one over and over but I was so enamored by life. There are so many beautiful facets of life that we never stop to appreciate or perhaps we simply never slow down enough to notice. A camera makes you slow down. A camera makes you stop and take notice and keep a record of the beauty that fills our days.</p>

<p>Painting:<br />
Painting has been a more purposeful learning experience. I first began drawing with charcoals and pastel chalks and fell in love with the blending process. In high school I finally decided to take an art class in order to learn some of the finer points of perspective and that is where I fell in love with painting.</p>

<p>Sewing:<br />
Sewing started much later in life. Jack’s mom, my sweet mother-in-law, is one of the craftiest people I know. The year we became engaged, she bought both me and my sister-in-law sewing machines. Up until then I had slowly been learning the craft of making baby blankets and had monopolized the use of her sewing machine. When I finally had my very own machine, there was no stopping me. I worked furiously to learn the basics of sewing and have since learned new techniques as I go. There is a lot to know about sewing, I fear I may never know it all, but I suppose that just keeps me plugging away at the task.</p>

<p>Cooking:<br />
I have always loved cooking and anyone who knows me, knows I love to eat. In the past, this food obsession has usually played out with baking, mostly because of my insatiable sweet tooth. My mom was the baker in our family, my dad the cook. I have learned many valuable lessons from watching and helping them throughout the years. While I do love the actual eating part of cooking/baking, the beauty of food is an aspect we often overlook. Half the joy of baking for me is making the food look fantastic once it hits the plate. I love incorporating as many colors as possible into the food I make. Chef Curtis Stone says that color equals health (unless we are talking cookies and food coloring).</p>

<p>So how does all of this fit into my life now? Jack and I have now been married over three years and our lives are just as busy today as they were on that wonderful day three years ago back in Oregon. Actually, our lives are probably more chaotic now than ever. Between work, school, homework, broken down cars, friends, and bills, we are moving 24/7, not to mention trying to fit in time to spend with one another. So why add crafts and cooking to these crazy days? Simple. It is who I am.</p>

<p>It seems from those beginning walks with mom, I didn’t have a chance and I am grateful for it. Aside from Jack, crafting gets me through the day. I get excited every time I get to craft or cook. By no means am I an expert. I don’t claim to be the next Martha Stewart, I am far from her level of expertise. I learn new things every single time I pick up a needle, paintbrush, or mixing spoon. To me, creating new things, whether through food or projects, is relaxing. Creativity is a release from this crazy life we lead.</p>

<p>As an aspiring neonatal nurse, I know this will continue to be a large part of my life. The stresses of a busy life will dwindle but the role of a nurse holds many daily challenges in itself that will, at times, try my sanity. I know, as petty as it may sound, these creative endeavors will help get me through those rough days.</p>

<p>So, this is why I blog. This is why I paint and sew and cook. It is all for me, my sanity, my enjoyment. Is it selfish? No. It is realistic. I believe every person needs to find that one thing that keeps them engaged, gets them excited, pushes them forward, and challenges them daily. While I blog for me, I share my experiences in the hopes of inspiring others. It doesn’t have to inspire you to cook or sew, but I do hope it inspires you to be creative and find your own niche.</p>

<p>I hope you’ve enjoyed reading a bit about the passion behind this blog. Thank you for your continued support. I hope you stick around the site and come back to visit often.</p>

    <p>Have you ever wandered down the art aisle of your favorite home decorating store and thought the images were overpriced and somewhat amateur? You think, a 6-year-old can paint a red circle in the center of a white canvas, right? I have spent many hours in these stores thinking I can paint this myself, and finally one day, I did.</p>

<p>Painting does not have to be a difficult or expensive endeavor. I firmly believe that almost anyone has the ability to make beautiful art for their home. The most difficult part of painting is learning to work with the paints. However, if the task of painting still seems daunting to you, I have another suggestion. Pastel Chalks.</p>

<p>Pastels are some of the first art forms I attempted when I was younger and I have recently come back around to using them.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/04/still-life-chalk-art/marys-gift/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/04/marys-gift-575x289.jpg" alt="" title="marys gift" /></a></p>

<p>For Christmas last year, I decided to craft some made-to-order art pieces for the women in our family. The picture above was made using a canvas, pastel chalks, and my fingers for blending.</p>

<p>This “painting” was created for Momma Mary (Jack’s mom). She has a shabby-chic look in her home and I thought the simplicity of the piece and the colors would match well.</p>

<p>I am fully convinced that anyone can make this still-life piece. The fruit shape can be accomplished free-hand style or by printing out a clip art fruit of choice. Simply print, trace, and fill in the shapes with your favorite color. Be sure to have a wet rag on hand to clean your fingers from time to time.</p>

<p>The pictures were very well received and are a great idea if you need an inexpensive yet thoughtful gift idea. Trust me, you can do this!</p>

    <p>In order to celebrate the nourishment that books bring to our lives, Milligan College library staff threw the college’s first ever Edible Books Festival at the P.H. Welshimer library. The event was a hit! It looks like next year the staff will throw a full-out competition due to all of the positive feedback.</p>

<p>Neither of my entries were as elaborate as I had hoped (this week was abnormally hectic). Jack asked me to make his entry since he works late Thursday evenings. I immediately said, “of course!” Unfortunately, I underestimated the precision required to make caramel apples. It will be a long time before I attempt those by myself again. Timing is key and between keeping caramel melted, crushing candy bars, and dipping apples, I did not have good timing. Oh well, I’ve learned my lesson.</p>

"Green Eggs" Cupcakes

</div>

<p>Anyways, my “Green Eggs” entry wasn’t anything special so I am not even going to bother giving you the recipe. The icing was the same powdered sugar frosting from my previous Rummy Shortbread Cookies post, minus the rum.<br />
Here are the other entries…</p>

Jack’s, oh so clever, “Candide” apples. He’s so witty.

<p>And a few other entries that were both creative and clever…</p>

<p>And there you have it, a few highlights from the first ever Milligan College Edible Book Festival. I am also including a little background information on the event for those of you who might be curious…</p>

<p>Judith A. Hoffberg originally came up with the International Edible Book Festival idea in 1999. Beatrice Coron created the Books2Eat website for participants worldwide to enjoy each others edible creations. The first Edible Books event took place in 2000 and has since taken off as an annual sensation.</p>

<p>Edible Book festivals take place on or near April 1 in honor of the French gastronome, Jeane-Anthelme Brillat-Savarin’s (1755-1826) birthday. He is famous for his book, “Physiologie du gout,” a witty mediation on food.</p>

    <p>With one month left of school I feel like I am crawling out of my skin with craft fever. I have been attempting to finish Avynlea’s knitted blanket for the past 2 months and this week I have finally made it about 1/3 of the way. I am now halfway through color number 3 which means I get to start over and finally have a pattern! Although the process is slow it feels so good to see progress.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/knitted-blanket-update/avynleas-blanket-002/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/Avynleas-Blanket-002-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="Avynlea's Blanket 002" /></a></p>

<p>So, here are some pictures of said progress. Maybe it will inspire those of you who also have half-finished projects lying around. You CAN do it! Perhaps slowly, like me, but slow and steady wins the race… at least that’s what I hear.</p>

<p>Here is a link to the <a href="http://thekitchencurtain.blogspot.com/2011/02/knitted-blanket-for-avynlea.html">original knitted blanket</a> post complete with instructions.</p>

    <p>Jack and I have a slight bias toward our little pizza joint back home, Ugo’s Pizza. Since moving to Tennessee, we have tried our best to find a comparable pizza joint but have had zero luck. Because of this, we now make our own pizzas, with each one becoming increasingly more creative.</p>

<p>This past week we decided to add fruit to our colorful masterpiece and it was delicious. Probably my favorite pizza so far.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/mandarin-pizza/food-060/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/food-060-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="food 060" /></a></p>

<p>As usual, Jack made the crust while I chopped up a variety of veggies. I’ve included a simple crust recipe from <a href="http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Pizza-Dough-I/Detail.aspx">All Recipes</a>. We prefer thin crust but feel free to substitute your favorite.</p>

<p><strong>Dough Ingredients:</strong></p>

<p>3 c. flour<br />
1 package of dry yeast<br />
1 c. water<br />
1 tsp. salt<br />
2 tbsp. vegetable oil<br />
1 tbsp. sugar<br />
Toppings:<br />
1/2 package of grape tomatoes<br />
25 pepperoni pieces<br />
1/4 c. green peppers<br />
1/4 c. onions<br />
1 cup mandarin slices<br />
1/2 c. cheese (we used, cheddar and pepperjack)<br />
1/4 c. pesto paste</p>

<p><strong>Directions:</strong></p>

<p>Heat oven to 375 degrees. Mix dough ingredients. Knead dough. Roll to fit your pizza stone.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/mandarin-pizza/food-048/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/food-048-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="food 048" /></a></p>

<p>Spread pesto onto crust. Chop all toppings.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/mandarin-pizza/food-050/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/food-050-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="food 050" /></a></p>

<p>Add meat, veggies, and fruit. I especially liked the sweeter grape tomatoes with the fruit.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/mandarin-pizza/food-059/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/food-059-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="food 059" /></a></p>

<p>Place in oven for 20 minutes. Check the bottom of the crust for crispy-ness and voila! A beautiful and tasty pizza.</p>

<p>Get creative and try substituting veggies with different fruits. Here’s another we’ve tried recently, strawberries!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/mandarin-pizza/srawberry-pizza-001/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/srawberry-pizza-001-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="srawberry pizza 001" /></a></p>

<p>The combination possibilities are endless. Good luck!</p>

    <p>Spring is here! After having almost an entire week of beautiful sun, we had one of the first big thunderstorms of spring last night.<br />
When we first moved to Tennessee, I never thought I would get used to the crashing thunder and giant bolts of lightning. Now, I love hearing the sound of heavy raindrops falling on the roof or slamming up against our glass door as the wind whips them every which way. It is soothing to listen to the rain and humbling to think about its mighty power.</p>

<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-fmPP7imBmTM/TYtDABgPmqI/AAAAAAAAAQE/kRnsFJArmpM/s1600/crafty%2B014.JPG"><br />
</a></p>

<p>In honor of what the beautiful sun and mighty rains bring to us each year (FLOWERS!), I thought I would post some simple arrangements thrown together at the farm in hopes of igniting creativity with your flowers at home.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/arrangements-from-the-garden/crafty-014-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/crafty-014-325x433.jpg" alt="" title="crafty 014" /></a></p>

<p>These arrangements are so simple. Grab one main flower and throw in leaves, grasses, ferns, anything you can find popping up in your backyard or even along the side of the road.</p>

<p>I love color so picking one or two main flowers that are bright and contrasting is my go-to plan. Hosta leaves, honeysuckle vines, grasses, and ferns are great fillers that you can find just about anywhere.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/arrangements-from-the-garden/img_0401-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/IMG_0401-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="IMG_0401" /></a></p>

<p>When in doubt, go simple. If you have lots of one beautiful flower, like this next picture, simply throw them all in a plain vase or pitcher to make the flowers stand out.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/arrangements-from-the-garden/flowers-041-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/flowers-041-325x433.jpg" alt="" title="flowers 041" /></a></p>

<p>Don’t worry about making your arrangements perfect and static like FTD. Fun, loose, and wild is the way to go… at least with flowers.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/arrangements-from-the-garden/crafty-011-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/crafty-011-325x433.jpg" alt="" title="crafty 011" /></a></p>

<p>Peonies are a beautiful and full flower. They are abundant around Mother’s Day and make arranging easy and quick. Below is a simple arrangement with only peonies and dianthus.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/arrangements-from-the-garden/flowers-007/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/flowers-007-325x433.jpg" alt="" title="flowers 007" /></a></p>

<p>And of course, daffodils are the perfect spring flower. These bright beauties are perfect by themselves. If you decide to combine them with another plant like forsythia (which is blooming everywhere here in T-town), be sure to wash the stems to get rid of their sap. It is not friendly to other plants.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/arrangements-from-the-garden/flowers-090-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/flowers-090-325x460.jpg" alt="" title="flowers 090" /></a></p>

<p>I hope these pictures have sparked some ideas. Now, go take a walk and explore the wide variety of spring plants and shrubs that will add the perfect flair to your arrangements. Be creative. Good luck and happy spring!</p>

    <p>Have you ever had a late night craving you just can’t shake? Well, I have for the past two weeks! I am not sure why, but suddenly a meatball sandwich sounded glorious. I don’t think I have ever eaten a meatball sandwich but I wanted one none-the-less.</p>

<p>When I realized this craving was not going away, I broke down and went to the store for some ground Italian sausage and made these quick and easy meatballs for my sandwich.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/quick-and-simple-meatballs/food-030/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/food-030-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="food 030" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>

<p>1 package ground Italian Sausage<br />
1/4 c onions<br />
1/2 c bread crumbs<br />
1/4 c shaved parmesan<br />
1 egg<br />
1 tsp garlic powder<br />
1 tsp oregano<br />
1 tsp Italian seasoning<br />
1 tsp pepper<br />
1/2 tsp salt</p>

<p><strong>Directions:</strong></p>

<p>Set oven to 350 degrees. Chop the onion into small pieces. Mix all ingredients.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/quick-and-simple-meatballs/food-023/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/food-023-325x433.jpg" alt="" title="food 023" /></a></p>

<p>Roll mixture into 1in. meatballs and place on a cooking sheet. Cook for 20 minutes.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/quick-and-simple-meatballs/food-028/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/food-028-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="food 028" /></a></p>

<p>Once the meatballs are done cooking, combine meatballs and a sauce of your choice in a large saucepan. I of course went with what we had in the cupboard which was a simple traditional spaghetti sauce (yes, from a can… <em>gasp</em>).</p>

<p>Only add enough sauce to be able to coat your meatballs after you’ve rolled them around for a bit. I used half of a 16 oz jar. I also added 2 tsp. of Worcestershire, 2 tsp. garlic, 1 tsp. oregano, and a dash of pepper and salt.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/quick-and-simple-meatballs/food-032/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/food-032-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="food 032" /></a></p>

<p>Let your meatballs simmer in the sauce for about 10-15 minutes.</p>

<p>If you are looking to make a meatball sandwich as well, slice some onions and mushrooms and saute over medium heat while the meatballs are simmering. Once the meatballs are finished remove your sauteed veggies and create your sub.</p>

<p>Oh so yummy with very little work. Good luck and happy cooking!</p>

    <p>As if baby clothes weren’t cute enough, last night I attempted to spruce up my <a href="http://thekitchencurtain.blogspot.com/2011/03/baby-skirt.html">original baby skirt pattern</a> with a few simple additions and I love how it turned out! I mean, basically everything is cuter small, but adding little ruffles…who can resist?!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/tiered-baby-skirt/baby-skirt-030/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/baby-Skirt-030-325x433.jpg" alt="" title="baby Skirt 030" /></a></p>

<p>This is very simple and if you are anything like me, you will feel so accomplished when it is complete.</p>

<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>

<p>Most of the piecing together follows the directions for the <a href="http://thekitchencurtain.blogspot.com/2011/03/baby-skirt.html">original baby skirt</a> I made a few posts back. Start by hemming the bottom edge of your main fabric pieces (the front and back).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/tiered-baby-skirt/baby-skirt-001/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/baby-Skirt-001-325x433.jpg" alt="" title="baby Skirt 001" /></a></p>

<p>Before you sew the front and back pieces together, cut 3-5 pieces of the same fabric (how many depends on how much you want them to overlap) that are the same length across as the front of the skirt (11in) and 3in. wide.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/tiered-baby-skirt/baby-skirt-005/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/baby-Skirt-005-325x433.jpg" alt="" title="baby Skirt 005" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Fabric Measurements:</strong></p>

<p>2-11×16 outer fabric<br />
2-11×16 lining<br />
3 or 5-11×3 outer fabric</p>

<p>I chose not to put the lining in this skirt but feel free to include in yours.</p>

<p>Next, hem the 11×3 pieces of fabric lengthwise on one side only (this will be the bottom of your ruffle).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/tiered-baby-skirt/baby-skirt-006/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/baby-Skirt-006-325x433.jpg" alt="" title="baby Skirt 006" /></a></p>

<p>After all the hems are sewn, align and pin these scraps to the front of the skirt. Place the fabrics with right sides touching and with the bottom-hem side at the top (essentially upside down).</p>

<p>Pin the 3in. pieces to the skirt starting at the skirt waist. Overlap the first ruffle by 1-1.5 inches and continue with each subsequent piece.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/tiered-baby-skirt/baby-skirt-012/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/baby-Skirt-012-325x433.jpg" alt="" title="baby Skirt 012" /></a></p>

<p>Sew the non-hemmed edge across the front of the skirt. Start with the bottom ruffle and work your way up. After each strip is sewn, remove pins and fold fabric over the seam so the seam is hidden underneath.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/tiered-baby-skirt/baby-skirt-017/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/baby-Skirt-017-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="baby Skirt 017" /></a></p>

<p>Once you have flipped each piece of fabric over onto itself, iron them down. You should have a piece of fabric that looks something like this…</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/tiered-baby-skirt/baby-skirt-023/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/baby-Skirt-023-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="baby Skirt 023" /></a></p>

<p>After all scraps are sewn to the front of the skirt, measure 1in. from each edge and sew vertically down the entire skirt, over the top of all of your scraps. Forgot to get a picture of this before piecing it all together. You can kinda see the seam lines on the picture below however.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/tiered-baby-skirt/baby-skirt-029/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/baby-Skirt-029-325x433.jpg" alt="" title="baby Skirt 029" /></a></p>

<p>The rest, pretty much follows the original tutorial. You’ll need to sew the front and back of the skirt with right sides facing each other, then fold over the top to make a pocket to feed the elastic through, and finally secure your elastic.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/tiered-baby-skirt/baby-skirt-030/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/baby-Skirt-030-325x433.jpg" alt="" title="baby Skirt 030" /></a></p>

<p>And voila! A cute tiered baby skirt to spruce up baby’s wardrobe. I used the same fabric and appliqued a circle on a plain white onesie to make the outfit complete. With this basic idea you can go crazy with creativity and ruffle all sorts of old clothes. Good luck and happy sewing!</p>

    <p>You know that feeling you get when you purchase the perfect pair of jeans and all you want to do is put them on and strut your stuff? Unfortunately, the jeans are way too long and you want to wear them now! This is a common issue in our household seeing as I am obsessed with jeans, have short legs, and am extremely impatient.</p>

<p>I used to think jeans were so difficult to hem and I never liked them quite as much after hemming because they no longer had the original stitching.</p>

<p>Then I discovered an easy way to keep your old hem without cutting off tons of fabric and possibly ruining your brand new pair of jeans. The original tutorial can be found <a href="http://sketchee.com/blog/2008/7/8/hemming-jeans-like-a-pro.html">here</a>. For someone like me who tends to have to sew things twice to get it right, this is a great technique.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/how-to-hem-jeans/hem-001/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/hem-001-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="hem 001" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>

<p>First, put on those fabulous jeans and decide how much material you need to remove. I love this hemming method because you don’t have to spend an hour pinning and re-pinning to make each cuff match the other. Just measure the excess.</p>

<p>Next, cut that measurement in half. If you need to take off 2 inches, now you are going off of a 1 inch measurement.</p>

<p>Now, make a cuff and measure this amount (the 1 inch) from the original hem edge, not the end of the jeans. Measure and pin all the way around your new cuff.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/how-to-hem-jeans/hem-002/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/hem-002-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="hem 002" /></a></p>

<p>Stitch along the edge of the original hem. The sides can get tricky. I always start on the outside seam, the one that shows the jean thread. This ensures that when you flip the pant leg right-side-out, the threads that stand out will align all the way down the leg.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/how-to-hem-jeans/hem-005/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/hem-005-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="hem 005" /></a></p>

<p>Flip the material inside the leg. Iron the new hem down and presto, shorter pants, same old hem. (If having the excess on the inside bothers you, simply cut it off.)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/how-to-hem-jeans/hem-007/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/hem-007-325x433.jpg" alt="" title="hem 007" /></a></p>

<p>I’ve included a picture of a wide hem as well. I find this hemming technique works best with wide hemmed jeans. It can be a bit trickier with the normal thin hems like the one above.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/how-to-hem-jeans/hem-009/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/hem-009-325x433.jpg" alt="" title="hem 009" /></a></p>

<p>Estimated hem time is about 10 minutes so you can be in your jeans and feelin’ good in no time. Good luck and happy hemming!</p>

    <p>While Jack and I absolutely love our little Tennessee home, living in an apartment has certain disadvantages. Aside from the constant din of teenage neighbor girls bickering over a borrowed sweater, we have no land to garden!</p>

<p>Some might consider this a blessing, never having to mow the lawn or weed the garden, but me, I crave the dirt. There are few things that compare to being outside with the sun on your shoulders and your hands in the ground.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/diy-planter-box/flowers-075/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/flowers-075-325x433.jpg" alt="" title="flowers 075" /></a></p>

<p>Last summer, Jack and I were surprised to find a ridiculous amount of planting pots available in stores but a severe lack of planting boxes, at least ones that didn’t jump into the hundreds of dollars range. All I wanted was to plant some veggies on our porch and pretend we had our own secret garden.</p>

<p>My dear husband, always willing to help with my ill-planned schemes, devised this simple box to show off my veggies. Did we research how to best go about this task? No, of course not, that would be silly right? Well, the plan worked, mostly. (I’ll get to the “what we learned” section at the end.)</p>

<p>We went to our local Home Depot and figured out the cheapest way to build the planter box, ended up being about $25. We bought two pine boards and had them cut into the following measurements:</p>

<p><strong>Measurements:</strong></p>

<p>1-10ft 1×12<br />
1-3ft 2×2<br />
Cutting Directions<br />
Cut 1×12 into 2-1ft sections and 2-4ft sections<br />
Cut 2×2 into 3-1ft sections<br />
Other Materials<br />
Screen door mesh (or some other screening with tiny holes)<br />
Screws</p>

<p>Build a Planter Box</p>

<p>Hopefully, the cutting makes sense. Next is simply a matter of piecing all the boards together. Obviously, your shorter boards are your ends and the longer, your sides. Assemble the pieces using screws (We used nails, but don’t do it. More on this later.)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/diy-planter-box/img_0238/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/IMG_0238-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="IMG_0238" /></a></p>

<p>After the four main boards are nailed together, attach the netting to the bottom of the box. This will help drain water, without draining dirt as well.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/diy-planter-box/img_0240/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/IMG_0240-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="IMG_0240" /></a></p>

<p>Next, attach the 2×2 blocks over the top of the netting, one toward each end and one in the middle. We did this mostly to keep it up off of the porch so there would be no rotting underneath from the drainage.<br />
Flip it over and you have a box for planting in!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/diy-planter-box/img_0247/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/IMG_0247-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="IMG_0247" /></a></p>

<p>Now, a couple things to think about and adjust.Our box worked wonderfully for the summer but had a few issues as we neared the end of growing season.</p>

<p>We used nails to piece our boards together, but with dirt and the expanding roots, eventually the pressure inside the box started to push out the nails and the boards began to separate.</p>

<p><strong>Suggestion #1:</strong> use screws, not nails</p>

<p>Also, in Tennessee we have quite a few thunderstorms throughout the summer and the wood took a bit of a beating.</p>

<p><strong>Suggestion #2:</strong> try using a different type of wood, one that is more hardy, or try treating it with some sort of outdoor weather sealer<br />
I think that about covers it all. I think this year we are going to try to make smaller individuals boxes instead of the long one and maybe paint them to add more color to the porch! Best of luck and happy growing!</p>

    <p>I was so excited to share this post today. I have been wanting to cook this meal for two weeks now and finally made myself take a break from homework to try it out.<br />
I found the original recipe on The Pioneer Woman’s website, posted by one of her followers. You can find the original instructions <a href="http://thepioneerwoman.com/tasty-kitchen/recipes/main-courses/island-shrimp-lettuce-cups/">here</a>. I adapted the recipe to fit the flavors I tend toward and, of course, those that I had on hand. Making the trek to our local grocery store during the 5 o’clock traffic is not exactly ideal.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/caribbean-shrimp-cups/food-091/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/food-091-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="food 091" /></a></p>

<p>Now to food…</p>

<p><strong>Ingredients (for 2):</strong></p>

<p>1 c. rice (basmati rice would be my first choice but any rice will do)<br />
8 large lettuce leaves</p>

<p><strong>Marinade:</strong><br />
1/4 c. lime juice<br />
1/4 c. teriyaki sauce<br />
1 tsp pepper</p>

<p><strong>Shrimp:</strong><br />
1 tsp. garlic<br />
1 tsp salt<br />
1/2 c. cornstarch<br />
16 shrimp, deveined with tails removed</p>

<p><strong>Salsa:</strong><br />
10 grape tomatoes<br />
2 green onions<br />
1/4 c. sweet onion<br />
1/2 stick carrot (peeled and then chopped)<br />
1/2 medium-sized orange (chopped)<br />
lime juice</p>

<p><strong>Directions:</strong></p>

<p>Start your rice. Prepare marinade by combining all ingredients with shrimp in bag. The original recipe has you marinade for an hour. I only marinated for 20 minutes and it was fabulous so don’t let the hour time frame stop you if you are in a hurry.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/caribbean-shrimp-cups/food-063/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/food-063-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="food 063" /></a></p>

<p>While the rice is cooking and shrimp marinating, chop up your salsa ingredients. Make sure you peel the carrots first and then chop up the peels so the salsa doesn’t feel heavy when it is mixed together. You could also use mango or your favorite fruit in place of orange. A citrus-tasting fruit is best. I added about 1 tbsp of lemon juice to my salsa, you can add to taste. I also sprinkled in a dash of garlic and pepper to taste.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/caribbean-shrimp-cups/food-069/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/food-069-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="food 069" /></a></p>

<p>Next, peel and wash your lettuce from the head. Head lettuce makes the best cups for eating. Our lettuce was just regular green leaf and it was harder to manage when we attempted to eat. Go ahead and lay your lettuce cups out so they are ready to fill once the shrimp is finished.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/caribbean-shrimp-cups/food-075/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/food-075-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="food 075" /></a></p>

<p>Mix cornstarch with garlic and pepper. Coat shrimp with mixture.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/caribbean-shrimp-cups/food-065/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/food-065-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="food 065" /></a></p>

<p>Heat 2-3 tbsp of oil in a pan. Make sure the pan is hot before placing in the shrimp. If it sizzles, you are on the right track.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/caribbean-shrimp-cups/food-078/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/food-078-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="food 078" /></a></p>

<p>Cook shrimp about 2 minutes on each side. There should be a beautiful golden brown coating when you flip them over. So exciting!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/caribbean-shrimp-cups/food-081/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/food-081-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="food 081" /></a></p>

<p>Now comes my favorite part! Dress your plate. The rice should be finished by this point. Scoop a spoonful of rice into each cup, followed by a salsa, and then top each with two golden shrimp.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/caribbean-shrimp-cups/food-094/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/food-094-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="food 094" /></a></p>

<p>These can be a bit messy, but they look so beautiful on the plate that I think it is worth the hassle. If you aren’t going for beauty you can always chop up the lettuce and make these into shrimp tacos. Happy cooking!</p>

    <p><em>This isn’t one of my typical postings but I figured it fit the “arts” category of this blog because of the musical interest. I wrote this article for Milligan and our local paper to announce a conference session being given by my violin professor, Dr. Kellie Brown. I thought this story was pretty neat and definitely worth sharing. Enjoy.</em></p>

<hr />

<p><em>Dr. Kellie Brown, chair of the Milligan College music department, will present her research on orchestras in concentration camps at the American String Teachers Association (ASTA) National Conference in Kansas City, Mo., on Thursday, March 17.</em></p>

<p>Brown’s session is titled “Alma Rosé and the Women’s Orchestra at Auschwitz: Lessons for Our Students on Tolerance and the Triumph of the Human Spirit.” Her research focuses on Alma Rosé, a woman whose music brought a glimpse of beauty and hope to hundreds of Auschwitz prisoners and even saved the lives of some of the musicians.</p>

<p>“The study of those who have gone before us and made their indelible mark on history, especially if it was through great personal sacrifice, is a worthy pursuit,” said Brown. “I think any time that type of subject can be part of an ensemble’s curriculum where students can learn more than just the notes, it is beneficial.”</p>

<p>Alma Rosé was the niece of the composer Gustav Mahler and the daughter of renowned violinist Arnold Rosé who founded the Rosé String Quartet. Alma was a successful violinist with a charmed life, but all that changed in 1938 when the Nazis took control of Austria, her homeland. Alma’s Jewish heritage made her a Nazi target, and she was eventually arrested and sent to Auschwitz in July 1943.</p>

<p>Despite all of the horrors associated with Auschwitz, Alma soon discovered the camp’s orchestra. Her fame and her family’s reputation made Alma the ideal candidate to conduct the women’s orchestra, which was, at the time, a mere rag-tag of women prisoners. Alma’s arrival ignited the orchestra’s success and respect, and it quickly grew to 50 members. Not only did orchestra members find hope through the music, but their value among the SS guards gave Alma the leverage to insist members were treated with decency. In this way, Alma was able to save these women’s lives through music.</p>

<p>Brown’s interest in this topic was a long time in the making. Sparked by a novel about a Jewish violinist living in WWII Germany, Brown quickly became interested in the lives of famous musicians during the Holocaust. After watching the movie, “Playing for Time,” which tells the story of the women’s orchestra in Auschwitz, Brown began her research on the life of Alma Rosé.</p>

<p>Brown’s lecture will provide the historical details about Alma Rosé and the Women’s Orchestra at Auschwitz. She will discuss the importance of incorporating this topic into the orchestra curriculum. In November 2009, Brown’s article, “Remembering Alma Rosé and the Women’s Orchestra at Auschwitz,” was published in American String Teacher.</p>

<p>Brown serves as director of the strings program and conductor of the Milligan College Orchestra. She is a frequent clinician and performer, and serves as the assistant conductor of the Johnson City Symphony Orchestra and assistant concertmaster for the Symphony of the Mountains.</p>

<p>In addition, she has written numerous compositions, arrangements and articles. In 2005 her first book, “An Annotated Bibliography of Musical Fiction,” was published by Edwin Mellen Press. Brown has studied at Furman University, East Tennessee State University and Appalachian State University and holds a bachelor’s degree in music education, a master’s degree in violin performance, and a doctoral degree in higher education administration, with an emphasis in music administration.</p>

<p>The ASTA National Conference is held yearly to benefit string teachers, students and performers. The conference provides opportunities to learn the latest teaching techniques and gain important information that will benefit students. The ASTA conference is the premier place to enhance skills and knowledge through sessions on pedagogy, string literature, college curriculum and more. Other topics on which Brown has presented in the past include “Incorporating the Elective Student in the College String Curriculum” and “Technology for the String Teacher.”</p>

<p>Today was the first workshop of spring out at <a href="http://www.auntwillieswildflowers.com/">Aunt Willie’s Wildflowers</a>. Twelve women from a local gardening club donned their boots and made the trek out to the farm for a bird’s nest workshop (pictures on website).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/spring-on-the-farm/on-the-farm-012-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/On-the-Farm-012-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="On the Farm 012" /></a></p>

<p>I went out to the farm yesterday to help Linda clean up the homeplace and make a few arrangements. We were so excited to be back outside working with the flowers. Yes, you heard right, flowers already! East Tennessee has had quite a few warm days making many of the flowers at Aunt Willies bloom early. This morning was sunny and with all the colorful flowers, I just had to take a few pictures to share with you all.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/spring-on-the-farm/on-the-farm-009/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/On-the-Farm-009-325x443.jpg" alt="" title="On the Farm 009" /></a></p>

<p>I couldn’t believe how many arrangements we were able to make from the early bloomers. Small, white pitchers made the spring colors pop. Don’t worry about not having much green filler to add to your arrangements, simple and loose combinations work well with these vibrant spring flowers.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/spring-on-the-farm/on-the-farm-007/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/On-the-Farm-007-325x534.jpg" alt="" title="On the Farm 007" /></a></p>

<p>These three pitchers in the window are my favorite arrangement location at the farm. We always have one stem of whatever is blooming in each pitcher. The simplicity of this arrangement against the beautiful landscape outside the window always makes a statement.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/spring-on-the-farm/on-the-farm-005-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/On-the-Farm-005-325x433.jpg" alt="" title="On the Farm 005" /></a></p>

<p>So, for those of you with a few bulbs popping out of the ground, grab your favorite jars or pitchers, cut a few stems, and bring some glorious spring into your home.</p>

    <p>My friend Kelly is getting married in a few months and asked me to sew her table runners for the reception. She brought over a sampling of fabric to work with on Tuesday and since I don’t need much of an excuse to make a big pot of soup, I went ahead and experimented with a new combination of veggies for the evening.</p>

<p>This soup was a bit spicy for me but Jack loved it so I recommend deciding what level of spice you can handle before you cut up your jalapeno. If you like just a little kick at the end I would only use 1/4 of a large jalapeno.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/apple-spice-soup/soup-and-bread-001/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/soup-and-bread-001-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="soup and bread 001" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>

<p>2 apples<br />
1 large sweet potato<br />
1/2 onion<br />
1/2 large jalapeno<br />
1/4 c. white wine<br />
1 32oz. box chicken broth<br />
1 tbsp butter<br />
1 tsp. garlic<br />
1 tsp. cinnamon<br />
1/2 tsp. salt<br />
1/2 tsp/ pepper</p>

<p><strong>Directions:</strong></p>

<p>Chop the apples, sweet potato, onion, and jalapeno into thinly sliced chunks. Add ingredients to large soup pan along with 1 tbsp. of butter. Add spices. Mix well. Add 1/4 c. white wine of your choice, mine was a chardonnay. Stir until ingredients are coated. Add half the broth, cover, and bring to a boil. Stir, add the rest of the broth and let simmer for at least 30 minutes.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/apple-spice-soup/soup-and-bread-002/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/soup-and-bread-002-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="soup and bread 002" /></a></p>

<p>You only have to let it simmer until the veggies are soft but the flavors are better if you let it simmer longer, plus cooking it longer makes your house smell fabulous!</p>

<p>Finally, pour ingredients into a mixer and puree. Presto your soup is complete! If you want a creamier soup, simply add a small amount of cream to the mix after you puree.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/apple-spice-soup/soup-and-bread-004/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/soup-and-bread-004-325x433.jpg" alt="" title="soup and bread 004" /></a></p>

<p>I also made this <a href="http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Herb-Quick-Bread/Detail.aspx">herb quick bread</a> from allrecipes.com to go with the soup. It was quick (which is what I needed) but had an interesting texture. I added rosemary, garlic, and thyme in mine and it paired well with the soup.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/apple-spice-soup/soup-and-bread-010/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/soup-and-bread-010-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="soup and bread 010" /></a></p>

<p>Good luck and happy cooking!</p>

    <p>Seeing as it is my spring break, I have decided to celebrate this week by working on all the fun little projects I have been dying to try for my new niece. Today’s project, skirts!</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I have no babies or dolls to get a good picture of the skirt, but trust me it’s adorable and the pictures don’t do it justice.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/baby-skirt/crafty-016/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/crafty-016-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="crafty 016" /></a></p>

<p>This skirt took me about 30 minutes to complete. All I did was cut two 11×16 pieces of one fabric (the pink) and two 11×16 pieces of cream for the lining. Start by sewing the two pink pieces together (along the 11in sides), right sides facing each other. Same with the inner lining. Then, with the two sets still inside out, slip the lining around the outside of the outside piece and line up your seams.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/baby-skirt/crafty-017/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/crafty-017-325x449.jpg" alt="" title="crafty 017" /></a></p>

<p>Next, grab both layers and fold over 1/2 in. at the top of the skirt and sew along the cut edge leaving a pocket to slip elastic through later on. The hem the two layers separately. I suggest hemming the lining at 1/2 inch and the outer layer at 1/4 in.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/baby-skirt/crafty-018/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/crafty-018-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="crafty 018" /></a></p>

<p>Last of all, cut a small slit through the top folded edge (be sure to go through both layers on the inside but not to cut all the way through the front of the skirt). Next, attach a 1/8 in. elastic strip to the end of a pencil (I used a pin) and slide it through the hole and all the way around the skirt. Once you have two ends of the elastic pull so it is snug and sew over the two pieces to secure.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/baby-skirt/crafty-019/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/crafty-019-325x433.jpg" alt="" title="crafty 019" /></a></p>

<p>Very very simple to make. I’m sure you could all figure these out on your own but hopefully, this will help get your creative juices flowing. I have 4 more fabrics that I am using to make these this week so I’m sure you’ll be seeing more pictures very soon. Happy sewing!</p>

    <p>I had an itch to sew today and decided to give these baby shoes a try. The pattern is simple to follow and can be found <a href="http://www.michaelmillerfabrics.com/blog/cloth_shoe.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/baby-shoes/crafty-010/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/crafty-010-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="crafty 010" /></a></p>

<p>I had a few issues getting equal tension on each foot, but I am pretty pleased at my first attempt. Looking forward to trying some different patterns. Baby Avynlea will have the coolest shoes on the block!</p>

    <p>I am one of those individuals who collects pretty much everything I have ever received. You might say I am overly-sentimental. I like to think I simply have incredible insight to possible future uses of said gifts. I mean, you never know when a ceramic lime green elephant will come in handy.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/spring-petal-mosaic/img_0088/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/IMG_0088-325x397.jpg" alt="" title="IMG_0088" /></a></p>

<p>One of the items I have acquired many of over the years are roses. I have dried roses from high school plays, Valentine’s days, and birthdays in jars all around my home. Well, last March, spring cleaning got the best of me and I decided to get rid of the clutter of jars. Of course, I couldn’t bring myself to throw away the entire collection of dried petals so I came up with a way to display the flowers in a more condensed manner.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/spring-petal-mosaic/img_0096/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/IMG_0096-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="IMG_0096" /></a></p>

<p>I took a canvas and painted the sides and background in varying shades of green. Painting the background made it easier to attach the petals without having to worry about covering every tiny hole. After the canvas dried I took craft glue and started attaching different shades of petals in groupings and then blending the groups together with a gradient of petals. I also added a few dried leaves to help make the green underneath blend well with the overall composition.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/03/spring-petal-mosaic/img_0091/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/03/IMG_0091-325x433.jpg" alt="" title="IMG_0091" /></a></p>

<p>I couldn’t be happier with how the piece turned out. I now have my own unique piece of spring art that ties together our flowered curtains and green couch in the living room.</p>

<p>I’ve been working on this blanket for my soon-to-be niece, Avynlea. Her mommy asked for pink to match the room. I ended up with 2 shades of pink that are girly but not necessarily little girl, girly. I like to think these colors are a bit sophisticated as well.</p>

<p>I chose Loops &amp; Threads brand Country Loom thread. I love this thread because it is a little fluffy so it hides mistakes well. My colors are (from right to left below), Rodeo, Warm Cream, and Snapdragon. Snapdragon is my favorite!</p>

<p>I like to knit while doing other things (watching Biggest Loser)so I decided not to count rows because I know I’ll get distracted. Instead I am knitting one whole ball of yarn (104 yards/95m) for each pink color (ends up being 16 whole rows-32 single rows) and separating them with 8 whole (whole=”down and back”) rows of cream. Another great striped blanket pattern can be found <a href="http://www.purlbee.com/the-purl-bee/2010/10/17/purl-soho-kit-the-super-easy-baby-blanket.html">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Blanket:</strong></p>

<p><em>Stitch</em>: garter (knit every row)<br />
<em>Yarn</em>: 4 snapdragon, 2 rodeo, 2 cream<br />
<em>No. of Stitches</em>: 115<br />
<em>Needle Size</em>: 9-10mm (mine is 9 wish I would have done a 10)</p>

<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>

<p>10-15 Shrimp (precooked, detailed, and de-veined)<br />
1 tbsp honey<br />
1 tbsp olive oil<br />
1 tsp ginger<br />
1 tsp fresh chopped sage<br />
1/4 c. onion (chopped)<br />
1/2 c. mushrooms (sliced)<br />
1 tsp pepper<br />
2 cloves minced garlic<br />
1 c. rice</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/02/honey-ginger-shrimp-with-rice/misc-1-2/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/02/misc-1-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="misc-1" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>

<p>Follow the directions for your rice of choice. Add 2 tbsp soy sauce and 1 tsp ginger to the rice before covering. Set the rice aside to cook and get started on the shrimp and veggies.</p>

<p>Warm the olive oil in a skillet on medium heat. Add shrimp, honey, pepper, sage, and garlic. Wait until shrimp is lightly browned and add mushrooms and onion. Cook until veggies are tender.</p>

<p>The rice should be done by now. So, now for the best part, dress your plate and enjoy!</p>

<p>I made these cookies for our New Year’s Eve get together this year and they were a hit. The cookie is a simple shortbread recipe that takes about 10 minutes to throw together and the frosting was a combination of ideas from Linda (<a href="http://www.auntwillieswildflowers.com/">Aunt Willies Wildflowers</a>) and the Pioneer Woman. You can see her original hard sauce recipe <a href="http://http//thepioneerwoman.com/cooking/2010/11/hard-sauce/">here</a>.</p>

<p>I also made these more recently for a catering event and added <a href="http://thekitchencurtain.blogspot.com/2011/05/my-first-catering-gig.html">chocolate shavings</a> to the top, making the shortbread look much more elegant.</p>

<p><strong>Cookie Ingredients:</strong><br />
2 c. butter<br />
4 c. flour<br />
1 c. white sugar<br />
2-3 tsp. vanilla extract (I always put more vanilla)</p>

<p><strong>Cookie Prep:</strong></p>

<p>Heat oven to 350 degrees. Soften the butter. Cream butter and sugar until fluffy. Add vanilla. Add flour. Mix well. Place dough balls onto a non-stick sheet. Bake for 10 minutes. Some recipes have you cook these longer but they tend to harden once you pull them out of the oven so I like to pull mine out early so they are still somewhat soft.</p>

<p>The frosting combines Linda’s powdered sugar frosting and the Pioneer Woman’s idea to add liquor to the mix, she uses whiskey, I went for rum.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/02/rummy-shortbread-cookies/christmas-pics-064/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/02/Christmas-Pics-064-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="Christmas Pics 064" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Frosting Ingredients:</strong></p>

<p>1 stick of butter<br />
1-1.5 c. powdered sugar<br />
2-3 tbsp rum</p>

<p><strong>Frosting Prep:</strong></p>

<p>Barely soften the butter and mix it around in the bowl. Add in the powdered sugar. I don’t normally measure this out. When Linda makes her frosting she uses more of a pour and stir, pour and stir effort until you get the consistency you want to frost with. Once that is all mixed together, add in the rum. This is really to taste so you might as well start out slow and taste as you go until you are satisfied.</p>

<p>Before you frost the cookies make sure they are cool. If the cookies are not completely cool you will have runny rum sauce all over the place.</p>

<p>Once cool, frost the cookies. My last addition to these cookies was to add a dusting of cocoa powder, really yummy addition. You could also try coffee grounds, brown sugar, chocolate shavings, the possibilities are endless.</p>

<p>This was my first real attempt to finish a quilt. I must admit that I have completed multiple quilt tops but this is the first I’ve actually finished. It took a good cause to get me motivated, so Happy Birthday, mom!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/02/a-quilt-for-mom/christmas-pics-147/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/02/Christmas-Pics-147-325x326.jpg" alt="" title="Christmas Pics 147" /></a></p>

<p>I didn’t use a pattern, my first mistake. Instead I figured out the dimensions I would need for her bed and started buying fabric. This is <em>NOT</em> a method I would suggest. Patterns are good, guessing is bad. However, if you’re anything like me and you just want to DO, then I wish you the best of luck and suggest you learn from my mistakes and buy much more fabric than you think you’ll need… because you’ll need it.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/02/a-quilt-for-mom/christmas-pics-149/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/02/Christmas-Pics-149-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="Christmas Pics 149" /></a></p>

<p>I started this quilt by sewing together strips of varied widths. Once they were sewn together, I cut them all apart into strips of strips. I then flipped the direction of every other strip and sewed them back together with a spacer color in between. You can make all sorts of creative quilts with varied hues of one color in varied patterns. Don’t be afraid to mix and match. Just have fun with spontaneity and see where your creative juices take you.</p>

<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>

<p>1 cup rice<br />
2 Tilapia fillets<br />
1/2 bunch of cilantro (chopped)<br />
2 roma tomatoes (diced)<br />
3 stalks of green onion (chopped)<br />
1/4 c. red onion (chopped)<br />
1/2 small zucchini (chopped)<br />
2tbsp olive oil<br />
1tbsp lemon juice<br />
1 tbsp lime juice<br />
pepper/salt/garlic powder</p>

<p><strong>Preparation:</strong></p>

<p>The rice takes the longest amount of time to prepare so go ahead and boil your water and get the rice going before you start in on the following steps.</p>

<p>Chop all the vegetables. Heat 1 tbsp of olive oil in a frying pan on low. Add in the vegetables and let them warm up slowly in the pan (do not add in the cilantro now). Add in just a dash of pepper and garlic (or more if you’re like us and can’t get enough garlic).Sprinkle in a bit of lime juice (1-2 tsp). Stir occasionally and leave the vegetables to warm up while you prepare the fish.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/02/lemon-tilapia-with-zesty-salsa/christmas-pics-050/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/02/Christmas-Pics-050-575x445.jpg" alt="" title="Christmas Pics 050" /></a></p>

<p>Heat 1-2 tbsp olive oil in skillet. If you have a large enough skillet feel free to cook both fillets at the same time. We eat so much fish that we buy the prepackaged fillets in the seafood section of the store. These kind are thin enough where they only take about 3 minutes to cook so it doesn’t take long if you choose to cook them separately. Once the olive oil is hot drop in the tilapia and cook about 1.5 minutes on each side (may be longer depending on how thick your fillet is). Sprinkle each side of your fish with pepper and just a touch of salt and well as a spray or two of lemon juice.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/02/lemon-tilapia-with-zesty-salsa/new-things-in-life-003/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/02/new-things-in-life-003-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="new things in life 003" /></a></p>

<p>Go ahead and add the cilantro to the vegetables and mix it up. With any luck your rice will be finished by this point. This is when I dress the plate. I use about a 1/2 c. of the rice as my base, then I lay the tilapia on top of the rice bed and go back over to the pan of veggies (make sure the cilantro is warm but not soggy looking) to dish the salsa on top of the fish.</p>

<p>This is an extremely simple pie to make and one that I wish I would have added cool whip and a few shavings of lime on top for the picture, but you’ll all do better right?</p>

<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>

<p>5 beaten egg yolks<br />
1/2 c. key lime juice<br />
1 (14 oz) can of sweetened condensed milk<br />
6 tbsp butter<br />
1/3 c. white sugar<br />
1-1/2 c. finely ground graham cracker crumbs</p>

<p><strong>Directions:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Crust:</strong><br />
Combine melted butter, sugar and crumbs until well-mixed. Press mixture into 8- or 9-inch pan. Bake shell at 375 degrees for 5-7 minutes to harden.</p>

<p><strong>Filling:</strong><br />
Combine lime juice, yolks, and milk. Mix well and pour into crust. Bake at 375 degrees for 15 minutes. Allow to cool and top with cool whip and graded lime rind.</p>

<p>The Doans run a specialty cut-flower farm called <em>Aunt Willie’s Wildflowers</em>. Linda spends most of the spring and summer growing cut flowers for farmer’s markets. She also teaches various flower arranging workshops and arranges flowers for weddings. Her workshops feature a variety of creative arrangements–from teapots to stumps, you name it, she can arrange in it. Check out Linda’s website <a href="http://auntwillieswildflowers.com/">Aunt Willie’s Wildflowers</a>.</p>

<p>Linda used this centerpiece for one of the workshops last spring and I, of course, fell in love with the idea. All she did was take an old chicken feeder, fill it with soil &amp; plant multiple lettuce varieties. The centerpiece at the workshop lunch was this feeder and the ladies were able to pick leaves of lettuce to add to their salads.</p>

<p>For any of you looking to bring a bit of country to your next get together, I highly recommend giving this a try.</p>

    <p>I made these diaper bags for a friend and also for my sister-in-law when we heard the big news. The bags are very very simple to make and require little sewing expertise, which is perfect for me.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/02/diaper-bag/com-016/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/02/com-016-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="com 016" /></a></p>

<p>The pattern is available at <a href="http://www.makebabystuff.com/">www.makebabystuff.com.</a> The website has a printable pattern making it easy to place right on top of your fabric and cut the right proportions. They have lots of other neat patterns as well but this is my favorite.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/02/diaper-bag/com-022/"><img src="jekyll_uploads/2011/02/com-022-575x431.jpg" alt="" title="com 022" /></a></p>

<p>I loved this pattern and instructions because once you’ve completed one bag you can play around with the dimensions of your paper pattern to make pretty much any shape/type of bag you want using the same instructions (will post pictures of some of my favorites later).</p>

    <p><em>I thought I would start off my blog with an article I wrote for Milligan College on a recent graduate, Autumn Pruitt, opening her own bakery. Check out her website (www.blissbakery.com) to see some mouthwatering treats!</em></p>

<p><strong>Sweet Success</strong><br />
<em>by Tiffany Weinbender</em></p>

<p>When it comes to successfully beating the current economic climate, 23-year-old Autumn (Hardy ’09) Pruitt, seems to have found the recipe for success. When Pruitt arrived at Milligan as a freshman, her love of baking was nothing more than an enjoyable pastime. Now, equipped with a business degree and a liberal arts education, Pruitt has turned her passion into a reality.</p>

<p>Pruitt and her husband, Luke, recently purchased the former Bickford Bakery in Omaha, Nebraska. On May 1, 2010, with a new name and a bright future ahead, Bliss Old Market Bakery opened its doors releasing the smell of fresh pastries into the Eastern Nebraska air. Since the grand opening, Pruitt has been baking relentlessly to facilitate the high demand for her tasty sweets.</p>

<p>As a Christian institution that offers a liberal arts education, Milligan was the natural choice for Pruitt, who graduated in the spring of 2009 with a double major in humanities and business with an emphasis in management. Pruitt applied every aspect of her Milligan education to turn her business into a reality. She even used her senior humanities project as an opportunity to develop the business plan for Bliss Old Market Bakery. The project served as the capstone of both her humanities and business majors.</p>

<p>“So much of the confidence I had in approaching the business plan for the bakery can be attributed to the painstaking process of writing one as a student with the guidance of my project advisers: Dr. Heather Hoover, Dr. Phil Kenneson and Dr. David Campbell,” said Pruitt. “I felt like I had the tested tools to tackle the process here in Omaha after going through a similar process in the classroom.”</p>

<p>Pruitt credits much of her success to the format of the business program and the way each class builds on those before. “My humanities 490 project was extremely helpful, but I wouldn’t have been prepared for that project, or my new endeavor, had I not had the less glamorous classes like accounting, business law, corporate finance and marketing, among others.”</p>

<p>Pruitt’s dream of opening her own bakery and coffeehouse began at the age of 19, although her love of baking goes back much further. In fact, she can’t remember a time when she didn’t love baking with her family. Pruitt acquired her baking expertise from her mother and began adding to her recipe collection weekly after graduating high school. Pruitt continues to experiment with ingredients and add her own personal recipes to the bakery’s recipe box.</p>

<p>As for the current economic climate, Pruitt believes that despite the downturn, this is a great time in her life to fully pour herself into her dream. Although Pruitt did not expect to open her business this soon, she felt the opportunity was simply too good to pass. She completed extensive market research on Omaha’s growing industry and more specifically the culture and climate of the downtown area, not least of which was obtaining a job in the bakery long before any talk of buying it. In doing so, she was able to learn about the equipment, recipes and tricks of the trade before committing to the process. It only took one day for her to realize that she didn’t just like the idea of owning a bakery but fell head over heels for it.</p>

<p>Pruitt is well aware of the hardships that come to small business owners, but she remains confident that her education, skills and enthusiasm will make this venture a success.</p>

<p>“The life of an entrepreneur sounds glamorous sometimes, but unless you are really passionate about the industry and have had a chance to wrap your mind around the immense amount of time it will require, you will not be satisfied. That being said, there is nothing more rewarding than seeing your dream realized and to have the opportunity to nurture its growth” said Pruitt.</p>

<p>Pruitt is an ideal example of how a liberal arts college like Milligan equips individuals to successfully reach their personal and professional goals. The college’s emphasis on applying faith to every facet of the world has impacted the way Pruitt runs her business.</p>

<p>“Milligan has reinforced the fact that you don’t need a religious title to be a servant leader or to minister. I treat people with respect. I provide my employee with a steady income and a healthy work environment. I listen to customers’ problems and we have become a part of each others’ daily lives. I try to live life with integrity and good character and to take a genuine interest in others,” said Pruitt. “Selling delicious baked goods is a good way to come in contact with my neighbors and develop a relationship with people I wouldn’t normally have the opportunity to meet.”</p>

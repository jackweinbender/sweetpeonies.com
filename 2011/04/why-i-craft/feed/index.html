		<description><![CDATA[Yay! This is great! &lt;br /&gt;Without cooking, sewing and crafting, etc., it is too easy to get burned out by the big things in life, like school and bills. With these things in our lives, we can remain calm and focused on the bigger picture.&lt;br /&gt;Anddd, I am sooooo happy that you have decided to share all of it on your blog! When I am busy editing my thesis, I stop to enjoy people&#039;s blogs and admire all of the wonderful things they are able to create!!!!! Love you!!!]]></description>

As you know I don&#039;t sew, can foods or weed; but I do love photography, flowers and art! I couldn&#039;t paint more than a stick person which is why I so appreciate those who bring art to others who appreciate art -- Beautiful article. Thank you for sharing -- YOU !]]></description>

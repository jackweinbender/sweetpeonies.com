		<description><![CDATA[In a vase I am not sure how long mums last. The potted ones I have, the grower said they would last about 5 more weeks outdoors. Sunflowers are probably the best lasting flower I can think of at the moment. Also seedum will last a long time but it isn&#039;t a typical flower available (I just know it from the farm). My goldenrod also lasted about a 1-1/2 weeks and would be a nice filler with sunflowers.]]></description>

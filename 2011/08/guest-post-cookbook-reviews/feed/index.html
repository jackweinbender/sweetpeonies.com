I have a group of Taste of Home magazines that I still enjoy using.  Although you can get most or maybe all the receipes on the internet, there&#039;s nothing like flipping through the worn pages to find just the right  tried and true.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Those are three of my go-to&#039;s! Our &quot;Joy&quot; is probably a mid-90s edition, and I use it when I need to know the background on something new, or when I know what I want to make and just want a reliably good, easy-to-find recipe. And BH&amp;G is my favorite when I need nostalgic suburban foods - how do I make spinach dip? (It also has the buttermilk coffee cake I bake for all new neighbors.) And Bittman . . . &quot;Everything&quot; is the first cookbook that made me feel like a sophisticated adult, and for that I&#039;ll always love it.

For desserts, I generally turn to Epicurious, sadly. (Perhaps a great dessert book will become a new quest . . .)]]></description>

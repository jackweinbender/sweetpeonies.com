Working on a cut-flower farm is not the idealized job I once thought it to be. No, I used to think cutting flowers all day would be simple, relaxing, and inspiring. Although at times cutting can be all of these things, more often working on the farm can be summed up as painful, dirty, and sweaty. Let me assure you, the cut-flower life is not one to be entered into lightly. Although aspects are very rewarding it is a difficult job–and this from someone who only works on the farm once a week.

I spent a few days this week, my spring break, helping Linda out at [Aunt Willies Wildflowers](www.auntwillieswildflowers.com). What do I have to show for my hard work? Sunburns, callouses, 50-or-so cuts and scrapes (and no, I am in _no way_ complaining) and of course a few photos just for you. For me, the hard work and painfully sore nights are worth being outside and enjoying the daily surprises of nature.

In the early months of spring, we (and I mean mostly Roy and Linda) take on a variety of tasks to prepare for the cutting season. These tasks include the following:  
-fill seed trays (each holding upwards of 200 seedlings at a time)  
-hoe flower beds  
-stake down landscape fabric  
-transplant seedlings into the hoophouse  
-clear dead bushes and plants  
-weed for hours on end.  
Getting the farm ready for the cutting season is a very dirty job, but of course, someone has to do it.

I took these photos to give you an idea of how barren the farm can seem early in the season and how incredibly fast the plants grow to fill all this empty space (check out last year’s images under [“Farm Photos”](http://www.sweetpeonies.com/farm-photos/) to get an idea). It never ceases to amaze me how many new plants are sprouting each week.

One month from now these empty beds will be full of flowers so hang on to your britches and keep checking back with us because them cuttin’ days are coming.

Those of you who know me personally, know that my experiences living in Ukraine have made me a passionate supporter of international adoption. After working in Ukrainian orphanages for 9 months, I firmly believe adoption is somewhere in the Weinbender future.

Because of this belief,Â I am taking a break from my usual posts to help spread the word about the Chase family Summer Adoption Auction. Please head over to the [Team Chase](http://teamchase4andcounting.blogspot.com/) blog to read their story and follow their journey as they raise money to adopt two little ones from Ethiopia.

Even if you choose not to buy anything from the auction, I think an encouraging word would go a long way as they move closer toward bringing home their Ethiopian children.

You can also purchase coffee that will go toward their adoption fund [here](http://www.justlovecoffee.com/TeamChase).

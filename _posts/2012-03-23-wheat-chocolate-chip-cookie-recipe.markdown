When individuals think about that moist, delicious, classic chocolate chip cookie, they typically don’t think _wheat_. However, ever since the hubby went on a wheat bread craze, we’ve had a lot of wheat flour in the house. Last year, he decided to try out some wheat chocolate chip cookies and we’ve loved the combination of chocolate and wheat ever since. So delicious!

I needed a batch of cookies in a hurry this afternoon so I went to a never-fail baker–good ol’ betty Crocker. This is basically [Betty’s recipe](http://www.bettycrocker.com/recipes/whole-wheat-chocolate-chip-cookies/391acf6b-df6c-49d3-894b-4ac705dc9cb2) with a few simple alterations to make it more moist.

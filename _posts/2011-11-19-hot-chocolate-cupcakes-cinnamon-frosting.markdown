Can I tell you a sad story? I haven’t baked in a month. True story. On Thursday, I was working on homework and I my oven called to me…or maybe it was my sweet tooth. Either way, it was time to bake. Our weather has been incredibly cold this week, I’m thinking winter is definitely here. So what better way to celebrate than with hot chocolate cupcakes and cinnamon frosting!

I saw a facebook status that someone had made hot chocolate cupcakes so I set scoured the internet in search of a recipe.

Here are two that I thought looked most appealing:

I didn’t have any unsweetened baking cocoa in the house and saw other recipes where they used an actual cup of hot chocolate so I figured, why not give it a shot?

The frosting is basically the same as the one for my [Rummy Shortbread Cookies](http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/02/rummy-shortbread-cookies/) except, no rum and I added 2 tsp. of cinnamon.

_Hot Chocolate Cupcakes:_

2 cups all-purpose flour  
1-1/4 tsp. baking soda  
1 tsp. salt  
1/4 tsp. baking powder  
1 cup hot water  
2/3 cup Godiva hot chocolate  
3/4 cup shortening  
1-1/2 cups sugar  
2 eggs  
1 tsp. vanilla

_Instructions:_

First, heat your oven to 350 degrees. If you have a silicone cupcake tray like me, lightly butter your tray. If you have a metal tray, line the muffin cups with paper liners.

Grab a bowl and mix flour, baking soda, salt and baking powder. In a separate bowl, mix hot water and Godiva hot chocolate until dissolved.

In a large bowl, beat shortening for 30 seconds. Gradually add sugar and beat well after each addition. Add vanilla and eggs, one at a time. Alternate adding flour and cocoa mixture to the mixture, don’t over mix.

Fill muffin cups about 2/3 full.

Bake 20 to 25 minutes. Allow cupcakes to cool slightly before moving them to a cooling rack to cool completely.

Tip: While these were baking, they seemed to puff in the middle then settle so they have a weird hollow middle but once they cool and settled they looked and tasted fine, without any hollow middle. So don’t worry if you go to stick a toothpick in and get a pocket of air.

Happy Baking!

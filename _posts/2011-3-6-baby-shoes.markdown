I had an itch to sew today and decided to give these baby shoes a try. The pattern is simple to follow and can be found [here](http://www.michaelmillerfabrics.com/blog/cloth_shoe.pdf).

I had a few issues getting equal tension on each foot, but I am pretty pleased at my first attempt. Looking forward to trying some different patterns. Baby Avynlea will have the coolest shoes on the block!

I’ve decided to jump on board with the thousands of bloggers sharing their “Week of Pinterest” ideas. It seems silly not to considering most of my blogging ideas are inspired by pins. If you haven’t had a chance to join the pinning movement, I highly suggest you jump on the bandwagon and start enjoying hours of pinned inspiration.

Be forewarned, Pinterest is highly addictive. Check out our boards by clicking the “P” in the right column.

This week’s pinning delights include the following:

1.) Table Arrangement from [The Found Blog](http://www.thefoundblog.com/home/category/weddings?currentPage=3)  
2.) Blackberry Red Wine Chocolate Cake from [the kitchn](http://www.thekitchn.com/blackberry-red-wine-chocolate-cake-love-olive-oil-165276)  
3.) Linen closet organization from [Martha Stewart](http://www.marthastewart.com/274903/25-closet-storage-and-office-organizers/@center/276989/organizing#slide_17)  
4.) Chicken baskets from [Carina-forum](http://carina-forum.com/ricette/appetizers/carne/0000027_en.php)  
5.) Yarn Containers from [Denise in Bloom](http://www.deniseinbloom.com/27-creative-uses-for-jars-and-recycled-bottles/)  
6.) Beautiful Basket Favors from [minha filha vai casar](http://www.minhafilhavaicasar.com/categoria/casamento/page/8/)

Happy Pinning!

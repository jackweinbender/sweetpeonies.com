Took out my good ol’ Betty Crocker cookbook the other night and threw together a combination of recipes that were oh so tasty. One part pound cake. One part coconut glaze.

**Pound Cake Ingredients:**

2 1/2 c. sugar  
1 c. butter  
2 tbsp amaretto (my substitute for vanilla)  
5 eggs  
1 tsp baking powder  
1/4 tsp salt  
1 c. evaporated milk  
1/4 c. coconut flakes (only if you are also making the coconut topping)

**Instructions:**

Heat oven to 350 degrees. Grease bundt cake pan with shortening. Beat sugar, butter, vanilla, and eggs with electric mixer on low for 30 seconds. Beat on high for 5 minutes.

Mix flour, baking powder, and salt in a second bowl. Beat flour mixture into sugar mixture on low speed alternating with evaporated milk. Add coconut. Pour mixture into pan.

Bake for 50 minutes, until toothpick comes out clean. Let cool. Sprinkle with powdered sugar.

Or add a topping of choice, like this…

**Amaretto Coconut Glaze Ingredients:**

1 c. sugar  
1/2 c. butter  
1 c. evaporated milk  
1 tbsp amaretto (my substitute for vanilla)  
3 egg yolks  
1 1/3 c. coconut flakes

Mix all ingredients minus coconut in a saucepan. Cook over medium heat for about 14 minutes, until consistency is semi-thick (like pureed soup). Add coconut flakes. Remove from heat and let cool about 30 minutes. Stir occasionally until consistency is spreadable.

Today was a great day. Instead of the isolated thunderstorms the weather man called for, today’s forecast was bright and sunny. A much-needed reprieve from the past two weeks of dreary rain, although I’ll take the rain over tornado warnings any day.

Aside from the beautiful weather, Jack and I were able to partake in a day of celebrations as our friend Adam graduated from a 4-year-long Master of Divinity program. Yay Adam! He will soon be attending Johns Hopkins so, ya, you could say were pretty proud to know this guy.

Anyways, after a fun day of friends and mocha cake, I am going to try to crank out this recipe for you. Jack and I broke out the ground turkey Thursday evening to make one of our favorite meals, Greek turkey burgers. If you are one to criticize the authenticity of food origins than you might want to stop reading now as I have no idea if this can really be considered Greek at all.

However, we do use Greek yogurt to make the sauce, so that’s the name I am going with.

We have made these numerous times and this last batch was the best yet.  Just goes to show, if at first you don’t succeed…well, you know the rest.

**Turkey Burger Ingredients:**

1 package ground turkey  
1/4 of a large sweet onion  
1/4 c. mushrooms ( I think I chopped 6 or 7 mushrooms)  
1/4 cup bread crumbs  
1 egg  
1 package of feta cheese  
1 tbsp Worcestershire  
salt/pepper  
oregano  
garlic powder

**Turkey Burger Instructions:**

Thaw turkey. Chop mushrooms and onions.

Combine turkey, Worcestershire, onion, and mushrooms in a large bowl. Add egg and bread crumbs.

If you think the mixture looks super liquidy, you either need to mix it up some more (using your hands works best), or add a few more sprinkles of bread crumbs. I added less crumbs this time and the burgers ended up super moist, which was awesome.

Next, add 1/2 the feta package to the mix as well as seasonings. Be generous with the seasoning, really… you can never over-season. General seasoning guidelines??? I would say add at least 1 tbsp of oregano and garlic and 1 tsp of salt and pepper. The image below has all the seasonings on top of the meat, you should also have this much seasoning.

Form mixture into patties. You should be able to get 4-6 patties depending on the size you prefer. Cook in a pan, not on the grill to prevent any slippage through the grate.

At the same time, you should sautee some onions in olive oil to add to the top of the burger. Trust me, it’s the right choice.

Now to the Greek sauce…

**Greek Sauce Ingredients:**

1 single container of Plain Greek Yogurt (in the size that costs $1)  
1/4 grated cucumber  
2 tsp. pepper  
1 tbsp dill  
1 tbsp olive oil  
1-2 tbsp lemon (tast it after 1 to see what you think)  
1-2 tsp. garlic

**Greek Sauce Instructions:**

Grate the cucumber, yes, like on a cheese grater. The end product will look something like this…

Combine all ingredients.Taste it as you go, you may not like as much seasoning as we do or you may want more. Either way, these amounts should be a good starting point.

All that’s left is to place your burger on a bun, add sauteed onions, lettuce, Greek sauce, and voila, deliciousness on a bun!

These are fabulous, really, truly, fabulous. Happy cooking!

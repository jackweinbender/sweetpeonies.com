Austin Countdown: T-17 days. That’s right, in just two weeks the hubby and I will be packing the wagons and heading to the big land of Texas where Jack will work hard on his PhD and I will lounge lazily by the pool, work on my tan and eat Fro-Yo. Have I mentioned I am still unemployed? Hopefully that will change soon after we get settled and then off to work for me as well. Now, on to more tasty topics…With most of our home packed into boxes, there have been few projects for me to share with you, that is, until this week.

Jack and I have been on a constant scouting mission for avocados. Avocados are my all time favorite summer food. Unfortunately, finding these delicious fruits is easier said than done. Produce options are ridiculously limited in our small town and when we do find a decent batch, they typically sell for around $2/fruit. Yikes! Lately, our local produce stand down the street has had a fairly good showing of avocado however and we have been taking full advantage.

This week, we had avocado every night. Since the weather here is hot and sticky, we wanted our meal to highlight the avocado flavor and also remain light and fresh tasting. Here’s what we came up with:

_Mango Avocado Salsa & Chili-Coke Chicken over Spinach and a Toasted Tortilla_

That sounds long and complicated as I write it out but it is pretty simple and incredibly delicious.

_Chili-Coke Chicken_

2 chicken breasts  
1 tbsp red pepper flakes  
1 tbsp Adobo seasoning  
2 tbsp Brown sugar  
pepper to taste  
coke to taste –start at 1 tsp  
rum to taste –start at 1 tsp  
2 tsp lemon juice

Boil 2 chicken breasts until cooked. Run cold water over chicken and shred. Mix above ingredients, adjust according to taste. All our sauces are done by taste so these are rough measurements. Toss chicken with seasoning and let sit.

_Mango Avocado Salsa_

1 Mango  
1 Avocado  
1/4 cup chopped red onion  
1/8 cup chopped fresh cilantro  
1/4 cup yellow tomato chopped  
1/4 Feta Cheese  
1 tsp lemon juice  
salt and pepper to taste

Combine ingredients by tossing gently. Set Aside.

Next, pour 1-2 tsp of olive oil into a pan. Allow the oil to warm up and then toss your tortilla into the oil. Cook on each side until slightly crisp.

Pile spinach on top of the tortillas, followed by the chicken and topped off with the mango avocado salsa. Enjoy!

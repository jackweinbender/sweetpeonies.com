A pause from the usual to reflect and remember:

[Remembering Caden: A Message to Parents to Cherish Their Children](http://timesofrefreshingontheoldpaths.wordpress.com/2012/11/21/remembering-caden-a-message-to-parents-to-cherish-their-children/) from Longing for Him.

A particularly touching post inspired by Caden Begganâ€“born 29th September, 2006, died 20th November, 2012.  
Please keep the family in your thoughts and prayers.

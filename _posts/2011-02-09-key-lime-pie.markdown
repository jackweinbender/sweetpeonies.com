This is an extremely simple pie to make and one that I wish I would have added cool whip and a few shavings of lime on top for the picture, but youâ€™ll all do better right?

**Ingredients:**

5 beaten egg yolks  
1/2 c. key lime juice  
1 (14 oz) can of sweetened condensed milk  
6 tbsp butter  
1/3 c. white sugar  
1-1/2 c. finely ground graham cracker crumbs

**Directions:**

**Crust:**  
Combine melted butter, sugar and crumbs until well-mixed. Press mixture into 8- or 9-inch pan. Bake shell at 375 degrees for 5-7 minutes to harden.

**Filling:**  
Combine lime juice, yolks, and milk. Mix well and pour into crust. Bake at 375 degrees for 15 minutes. Allow to cool and top with cool whip and graded lime rind.

Happy Friday! Today I’d like to take a moment to share with you five beautiful blogs & websites that I just can’t get enough of. These are my daily go to blogs for inspiration and an overall feeling of goodness. Check them out and be sure to spread a little love their way.

[KinfolkMag](http://www.kinfolkmag.com): A photographic/journal-style blog that provides casual entertainment ideas. They put out a beautiful magazine that is available for purchase on the site and also have a [Journal site](http://www.kinfolkmag.com/journal/) as well as [galleries](http://www.kinfolkmag.com/gallery/) of their various events.

[Sunday Suppers](http://sunday-suppers.com/): Beautifully staged photographs and details of class-cooking-dining experiences, pairing friends and food. Classes are held in a waterfront loft in Brooklyn, NY and are taught by local Chefs. The food is market fresh, local and organic and the approach is to create seasonal and fresh meals together.

Grilling is one of the things I most look forward to about summer and this past weekend was perfect grilling weather.

Growing up, dad was always our designated grill master. I’d like to think I learned a few things from him throughout the years. However, I had never tried to grill the sweet potatoes before this past Saturday.

Prior to living in the south, I had never eaten a sweet potato. I suppose you could argue that I must have tried yams at Thanksgiving or something to that effect, but I am convinced it never happened.

In Tennessee, everyone eats sweet potatoes, also known as yams (although there is a difference between the two). Apparently, this root vegetable is some sort of nutrient super food, outranking all other vegetables in nutritional value in a 1992 study by the Center for Science in the Public Interest.

Anyways, all that to say, this weekend, we grilled our sweet potatoes and they were fantastic. We also grilled baby asparagus and zucchini (my all-time favorite grilled veggie).

**Our simple and tasty grilling tips:**

Using a brush, lightly coat veggies with olive oil. Sprinkle with garlic and pepper.

Grill until tender.I know… it’s super complicated, but simple always turns out the best.

Another method for the zucchini is to coat with Italian dressing instead of olive oil, then sprinkle with garlic. Delicious!

Best of luck with your grilling days to come. May it bring you and yours closer together this summer.

With only a couple of weeks until classes start again for the husband, we are determined to make the most of the beautiful weather and our remaining free time. Sadly, hiding out in the comforts of an air conditioned home in Texas in the middle of the summer sounds and feels all too enticing. Today however, we laced up our hiking boots and set out in search of new adventures.

Unfortunately, our lazy Saturday morning attitude came back to bite us in the caboose and we didn’t get out to the trails until almost noon.

Today’s adventures took us to Austin’s Barton Creek Greenbelt. The trails have large limestone cliffs, dense foliage and shallow bodies of water (although today, they were dry-as-a-bone).

For those of you (like me) who have never heard of a greenbelt, it is a protected natural or semi-natural environment around an urban area. Barton Creek is maintained by the Parks and Recreation Department of Austin and is meant to improve air quality, provide urban residents with access to countryside and outdoor recreation, and give character to urban areas.

Since it was nearly noon by the time we arrived at the trails, our hike and “go-get-em attitudes” didn’t last long. However, I wouldn’t leave without snapping a few photos to share with you all.

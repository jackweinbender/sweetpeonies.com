I love November. This is not simply a passing phrase for me, I wholeheartedly love November! November is my Christmas–if a November fairy came to my house, I would clean the chimney, set out cookies and milk, and probably write him a letter.

There are many aspects of November that I love, however, the best part for me, is of course, Thanksgiving. Growing up, this was always my favorite family holiday. We would all watch the parade, eat German pancakes, and sip hot chocolate. Then mom would get to work making her famous rice salad while dad worked on the turkey. Kendra and I would help where we could and sing along to our favorite tape, “Amy Grant Christmas.” The joy of Thanksgiving was simple–we were together and we were thankful.

This togetherness is what I most love about Thanksgiving. Living in Tennessee, I have come to realize the extent to which I’ve cherished my family’s Thanksgivings together. Four years have gone by without a family Thanksgiving and every year I realize just how much those days meant to me. We are no longer able to be together physically, but I carry my family with me throughout the holidays–continuing their traditions, remembering the past, and looking forward to what the future holds for all of us. I am incredibly grateful for the times we have had together.

In the spirit of Thanksgiving, this month I will be highlighting a few of the many things that I am grateful for and I would LOVE to hear from you too! Leave a comment or head to our facebook page and tell us your favorite Thanksgiving memory, food, tradition, or simply tells us what you are thankful for this year.

Wishing you a very blessed November, may you be filled with thanks and surrounded by those you love and who love you.

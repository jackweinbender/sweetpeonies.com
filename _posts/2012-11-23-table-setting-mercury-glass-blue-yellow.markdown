I hope each of you had a fantastic Thanksgiving holiday with your loved ones. We had the pleasure of having a family member in town this year, hooray! I always miss our family around the holidays and canâ€™t say enough about how thankful we were to have my mom in town. Here is just a tiny glimpse at our shiny Thanksgiving table setting.

[![Blue & Mercury Glass Table Setting](jekyll_uploads/2012/11/Thanksgiving-575x359.jpg "Thanksgiving")](http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/11/table-setting-mercury-glass-blue-yellow/thanksgiving/)

Blue China: TJ Maxx  
Grey Napkins: Target  
Yellow Raffia: Walmart  
Mercury Glass Votives: Target

This table setting was incredibly simple to put together and the mercury glass votives went a long way to making it dressy for the holiday.

Enjoy the rest of your Thanksgiving weekend. Happy Thanksgiving!

Fall break is over and what a break it was. One of my dearest friends flew out from Oregon with her 1-year-old son and husband. We were able to visit with one another for 5 whole days. It has been 2 years since we have seen friends from home so I cannot express to you just how wonderful it was to be with them again. Jack and I are truly blessed with the friends we have both back home and here in Tennessee. Here’s a family picture from our day out at the farm.

What else did we do on our Fall break? Well, we held a little pumpkin carving party, took a drive up to Roan Mountain, and best of all…attended the Woolly Worm Festival in Banner Elk, North Carolina! Yep, you read it right, the Woolly Worm Festival.

According to their [website](http://www.woollyworm.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&layout=blog&id=34&Itemid=56), last year’s festival had over 20,000 visitors from all over the East coast and 1,000 participants racing their woolly worms.

I bet you are wondering, “how exactly do you race a woolly worm…?” Up a string of course. The Woolly Worm trainers, race their worms up a 3 ft. string in small heats throughout the day until the final heat in the afternoon, where the finalists compete for $1000\. This year’s [winner](http://www.woollyworm.com/), was YoYoMa from NC.

I took some pictures of the festival, they are nothing special but I wanted to give you an idea of how big of a deal this really is…

Now, don’t mistake this festival for just a hokey Southern gathering. No, there is a point to the worm racing, are you ready for this? Apparently, the woolly worm winner predicts what type of winter we are going to have, week by week, by the width of his stripes.</nbsp>

This year’s weather, week 1-13: Lt Snow & Cold, Cold & Snowy, Cold & Snowy, Cold & Snowy, Lt Snow & Cold, Normal Cold, Cold & Snowy, Cold & Snowy

So there you have it, looks like lots of cold and snowy weather coming our way!

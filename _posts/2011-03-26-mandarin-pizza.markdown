Jack and I have a slight bias toward our little pizza joint back home, Ugo’s Pizza. Since moving to Tennessee, we have tried our best to find a comparable pizza joint but have had zero luck. Because of this, we now make our own pizzas, with each one becoming increasingly more creative.

This past week we decided to add fruit to our colorful masterpiece and it was delicious. Probably my favorite pizza so far.

As usual, Jack made the crust while I chopped up a variety of veggies. I’ve included a simple crust recipe from [All Recipes](http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Pizza-Dough-I/Detail.aspx). We prefer thin crust but feel free to substitute your favorite.

**Dough Ingredients:**

3 c. flour  
1 package of dry yeast  
1 c. water  
1 tsp. salt  
2 tbsp. vegetable oil  
1 tbsp. sugar  
Toppings:  
1/2 package of grape tomatoes  
25 pepperoni pieces  
1/4 c. green peppers  
1/4 c. onions  
1 cup mandarin slices  
1/2 c. cheese (we used, cheddar and pepperjack)  
1/4 c. pesto paste

**Directions:**

Heat oven to 375 degrees. Mix dough ingredients. Knead dough. Roll to fit your pizza stone.

Spread pesto onto crust. Chop all toppings.

Add meat, veggies, and fruit. I especially liked the sweeter grape tomatoes with the fruit.

Place in oven for 20 minutes. Check the bottom of the crust for crispy-ness and voila! A beautiful and tasty pizza.

Get creative and try substituting veggies with different fruits. Here’s another we’ve tried recently, strawberries!

The combination possibilities are endless. Good luck!

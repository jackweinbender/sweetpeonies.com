Milligan College holds an annual day off of classes every spring called “Wonderful Wednesday.” In the past, this event has also come to be called, “Terrific Tuesday” or “Marvelous Monday”. A welcomed reprieve from studying for finals, Wonderful Wednesday is always a surprise for both students and faculty.

This year’s theme was “Come Sail Away…” The Campus Activities Board is in charge of planning activities such as water sports, food-eating contests, and various competitions around campus for students to participate in.

A few of this year’s highlights included a giant waterslide, go-kart races, bungee-jumping, putt-putt course, ultimate frisbee, dodgeball and volleyball competitions and much more.

Seeing as Wednesdays are my main Public Relations work day, I had the pleasure of taking pictures all afternoon! I met with various press members who stopped by campus to take a few pictures for the local newspapers and then, I too, walked around in the beautiful sunshine snapping a few photos while simultaneously burning my shoulders.

Certain family members,you know who you are, are always asking me for photos so, I thought I would share a few of my favorites from our wonderful day. Enjoy!

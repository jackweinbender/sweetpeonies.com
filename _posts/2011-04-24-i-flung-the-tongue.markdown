Happy Easter! Seeing as we are so far away from home, Linda Doan, [Aunt Willies Wildflowers](http://auntwillieswildflowers.com/ "Aunt Willie's Wildflowers"), invited Jack and I to join in their Sunday afternoon celebrations.

The Doans have become quite famous in our little neck of the woods for a variety of reasons. Linda taught at Milligan as the health and fitness professor, Roy (her hubby), retired from teaching mathematics at a local school. They own a farm, raise and sell cattle, grow and sell cut flowers, and volunteer their time and home every week.

However, what the Doans are perhaps most famous for is their much anticipated cow-tongue flinging.

Yes, that’s right, today we flung the tongue.

Since Roy raises grass-fed beef, there are apparently a vast supply of cow tongues each year that the Doans are able to freeze and then thaw for various occasions.

The game concept is simple, throw or toss the tongue into a watering trough, moving farther back with each fling. If you miss, you’re out. Linda was today’s champ.

I was a complete failure at the game. I’d like to say it was simply because IT WAS SO GROSS, but, if I am being honest, I should really blame my more-than-pathetic flinging abilities. As you can see in the following picture, Roy was less than satisfied with my “touch as little as possible” flinging method.

I realize this post has almost nothing to do with crafts, but I thought you all would enjoy hearing about this unusual method of celebration.

And, if you are disappointed in the irrelevance of this post,I hope you are able to at least appreciate the beautiful East Tennessee scenery. Happy Easter!

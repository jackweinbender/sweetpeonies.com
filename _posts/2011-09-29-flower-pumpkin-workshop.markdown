Tuesday evening was the night you’ve all been waiting for…the pumpkin workshop. I think I say this every time but, this workshop just might be my absolute favorite. The pumpkin workshop brings a little sophistication to the traditional idea of carving pumpkins for the fall.

I went straight to the workshop from class so these photos are courtesy of Linda. Thank you Linda!

The pumpkin below was the demo pumpkin I made for the group.

Would you like to make your very own flower pumpkin? Here’s what you need and a few pointers to get you started:

**Tools:**

1 pumpkin (any size)  
1 plastic cup (like the coca cola ones from McDonalds, the height depends on how big your pumpkin is)  
Flowers  
1 block of oasis

**Directions:  
**  
1\. Soak a block of oasis in water.  
2\. Trace the rim of your cup on top of the pumpkin. Cut along the traced line.  
3\. Hollow out the inside of your pumpkin.  
4\. Cut oasis edges so it fits snugly into your plastic cup, leave the oasis slightly higher than the cup’s rim.  
5\. Insert cup into the pumpkin and add water to the cup.  
6\. Insert flower stems into the oasis as you shape your arrangement.

Now comes the fun part, the flowers! Don’t let a lack of flowers deter you from attempting this project. You can use pretty much anything to fill your pumpkin, leaves, grasses, bushes, dried flowers, fresh flowers, weeds, etc.

Start with a plant that will drape the top of your pumpkin, so the rim of the cup and oasis do not show. I chose peppers and weeds with berries because they are heavy enough to drape down over the pumpkin.

Next, choose 1 or 2 fillers to give some weight to the base of the arrangement and fill in the larger spaces. I used bunches of goldenrod and a few branches of leaves with a different texture than the leaves towards the bottom of the pumpkin.

Now, choose a few staple flowers to draw the eye. You want your main flowers to stay fairly low to the pumpkin, anchoring the arrangement (notice the height of my pink dahlia and Kristin’s red dahlia).

After that, I basically just add extra ornamentals of varying heights for finishing touches. There are blue berry-like pods (castor bean), cattails, and some longer stems of goldenrod for height.

And, just to prove that you can put together a spectacular looking pumpkin with a variety of plants, here are just a few of the pumpkins from Tuesday’s crew.

They were all so wonderful but I can only fit so many pictures into my post. Be sure to let the ladies know how wonderful their pumpkins look and if you put together a pumpkin of your own, send us a picture!

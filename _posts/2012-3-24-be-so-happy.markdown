All the beautiful sunshine this past week has made me a very happy camper. Nothing brings a smile to my face more quickly than waking up to rays of sunshine streaming through my bedroom window in the morning–nothing except maybe this sweet little poster from [Elisandra Sevenstar’s Etsy Shop](http://www.etsy.com/shop/sevenstar?utm_source=convo&utm_medium=trans_email&utm_campaign=convo_html&page=1).

I have seen this popular design popping up all over Pinterest and was finally able to trace it back to the source. Elisandra’s ETSY store has some wonderful designs that are both colorful and cheerful.

The “be so happy” whale is definitely my favorite and, along with the sunshine, never fails to bring a smile to my face.

Be sure to stop by her ETSY site or [website](http://elisandraillustration.wordpress.com/) and show her some love.

Be happy!

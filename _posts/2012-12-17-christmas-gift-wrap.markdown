It’s beginning to look a lot like Christmas in our home and that means it’s time for one my favorite tasks-wrapping presents. Yay!

This year, I found beautiful gold & red shiny gift wrap from TJ Maxx for $3\. Although the gift wrap was much fancier than my typical gift wrap, I wanted to incorporate some of the simple touches that I have used in the past. I chose cards that were made of simple recycled brown cardstock and wrapped each gift in twine.

These gifts look quite stunning under the tree this year and will hopefully be well received by friends and family.

Have you ever had that feeling of dread when you reach into the dark recesses of your cabinets only to find an empty space in place of that vital ingredient necessary for your meal? I had such a feeling a few weeks ago. Unfortunately, I did not discover the lacking ingredients (yes, multiple) until I was fully emerged in cooking the meal, already at the point of no return.

After a small mental tantrum, I pulled myself together and set to work finding and making substitutes.

Here is the link to the [original recipe](http://www.skinnytaste.com/2011/03/shrimp-creole.html).

And here are the ingredients to our version, which, by the way, turned out to taste fantastic.

**Ingredients:**

2 tsp olive oil  
1/2 cup yellow onion, chopped  
1/2 cup green bell pepper, chopped  
1/2 cup celery, chopped  
2 cloves of garlic, minced  
2 cups tomato sauce  
1 teaspoon of chili powder (I also sprinkled more haphazardly throughout the cooking process to our liking)  
1/2 tsp. salad supreme seasoning  
1 tbsp of all purpose flour  
2 tbsp water  
1/2 lb of large shrimp, peeled and deveined  
2 tsp Soy sauce  
1/4 jalapeno chopped finely  
3 green onions chopped  
2 tbsp parsley  
1 tsp oregano  
1 teaspoons salt  
1 teaspoons garlic powder  
2 teaspoons paprika  
1/2 tsp. pepper  
1 tbsp. lemon juice  
1 c. white rice

*I know that seems like a lot of seasoning but it was in lieu of the Cajun seasoning which includes all of those ingredients and a few more.

**Instructions:**

Begin by preparing your rice. Follow instructions on bag.

Heat olive oil on medium heat and add onion, bell pepper, celery, and minced garlic. Once the vegetables are tender, add tomato sauce, soy sauce, and all seasonings. Bring to a boil, cover and reduce to a low heat. Simmer 15-20 minutes.

Lightly season shrimp with garlic, paprika, chili powder, and lemon juice. Warm 1 tbsp of olive oil in a separate pan and cook shrimp. Add shrimp to sauce. Cook 5 minutes.

Mix flour and water and add to tomato mixture. Cook 5 more minutes.

Add chopped green onions. Taste, taste, taste! Adjust any seasonings necessary to fit your preference.

Serve over rice and enjoy!

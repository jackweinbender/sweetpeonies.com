This morning I dragged my lazy bones out of bed at 6:30 and drove over to Grandview Christian Church, to help Linda set up for a workshop of sorts. Linda was guest speaking/teaching on the topic of flower ministries.

As the go-to-flower gal around Grandview, Linda is well known around church, which is how I came to work on the farm with her.

She faithfully donates her beautiful arrangements to Grandview services every week for all to enjoy.

Flowers are a wonderful way to get involved at your local church. Don’t grow cut flowers? That’s ok! You would be amazed at the variety of arrangements you can make with tree branches, grasses, and even weeds.

The pictures I’ve included are just a few from this morning’s workshop and should demonstrate how simple starting your own flower ministry could be. Enjoy!

A couple weekends ago, I had the pleasure of helping out with baby shower decorations for my sweet friend Jane. Her and the hubster are expecting their first child in the next few weeks. My friend Kristin and I decided to broaden the trendy whale baby shower theme to a sailor baby shower. Instead of cutesy whales, we went with boyish flags in bold colors and homemade life preservers.

Kristin found these awesome nautical signal flag patterns at [PurlBee: Laura’s Loop](http://www.purlbee.com/the-purl-bee/2011/6/26/lauras-loop-nautical-flag-napkins.html). The ones on the site are napkins, ours were simply flags made out of felt squares. To assemble, we cut strips of felt and hot glued them onto larger blocks of felt, making a flag for each letter of the alphabet. The life preservers are from a picture Kristin found on Pinterest. Unfortunately there was not a usable link to share with you. To assemble we used 2 foam rings, cut them in half to make 4 rings and wrapped white and red streamers around them to make little life preservers. Linda from [Aunt Willie’s Wildflowers](http://auntwillieswildflowers.wordpress.com/) brought the daffodils in blue vases to place in the center of the life preservers.

I found the adorable origami paper boats at [I Love This and That](http://ilovethisandthat.blogspot.com/2013/03/origami-paper-boat.html). I used colored printer paper and cardstock instead of the vellum and cut my paper to 5×7.5in. I would recommend using paper no thicker than printer paper, the cardstock boats were a bit more difficult to fold once you get to the last steps.

The food selection consisted of a beautiful,colorful & tasty salad bar.

And, of course, what baby shower is complete without the mother-to-be and all her friends and family.

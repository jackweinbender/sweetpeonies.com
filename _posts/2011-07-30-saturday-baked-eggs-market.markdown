This morning was a beautiful Saturday morning. It was one of those mornings that make all that waiting and wishing for the weekend to arrive, completely worthwhile. After setting my alarm for 8 a.m., in an effort not to sleep the day away, I woke up to enjoy a hot cup of java.

Contrary to popular belief, the best part of waking up is not always Folgers. In my case, it was Coffee Co. Tanzanian Peaberry. After a sip of java and a hot shower, I walked around the apartment in my very comfy, over-sized sweats.Next, I set to work making a breakfast treat for my Jakie as he slowly brushed the sleepy from his eyeballs. What was our special Saturday treat? Ramekin baked eggs. Yum!

Lately, I’ve seen numerous versions of baked and coddled eggs: Caprese, southwest, seafood, etc. I decided to throw together my own version. It’s nothing special, just my staple ingredients for the first attempt. I think next time I am going to go with a curried egg theme. Here’s what I did this morning:

**Ingredients:**

2 tbsp butter  
6 basil leaves  
1 small tomato  
1/8 c onion (one slice down an onion, all rings)  
pinch of cheddar cheese  
2 tsp pepper  
dash of salt

**Directions:**

Butter 2 ramekins. Chop tomato, onion, and basil. Drop 1/2 of each ingredient into the bottom of ramekin, yes salt and pepper too.

Crack one egg (or two if you are really hungry) and drop into the ramekin. Sprinkle the remaining 1/2 of veggies, basil, and seasoning on top. Bake at 350 degrees for 8 minutes, then broil for 3 minutes.

Carefully remove ramekins from the oven and enjoy! I read numerous articles that also added a hint of cream to the mix. I wanted to give it a shot but totally forgot. If you are brave, go ahead and give it a try. I’ll be sure to include cream next time and let you all know what it added.

Back to my Saturday morning…after enjoying a delicious ramekin baked egg, Jack and I decided to head to the Saturday market to visit Roy and Linda. Here is one of my favorites from the morning.

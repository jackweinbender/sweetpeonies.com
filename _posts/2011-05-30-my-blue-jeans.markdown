I think David Dundas’ song “Jeans On” pretty much sums up my attitude toward blue jeans. If you have only heard the Keith Urban version please go to this [link](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWdcZqG02Ls) and listen to the original before reading further.

_“When I wake up in the mornin’ light_  
_I pull on my jeans and I feel all right_  
_I pull my blue jeans on_  
_I pull my old blue jeans on (cha-cha)_  
_I pull my blue jeans on_  
_I pull my old blue jeans on (cha-cha)”_

It isn’t because the lyrics are all about the greatness of jeans (because they’re not) however, the melody of this song is exactly how I feel when I pull my blue jeans on.

When I wake up in the mornin’ light, pulling on my jeans **really does** make me feel alright. Cha-Cha!

This post was actually inspired by a post I read a few days ago at [Made](http://www.dana-made-it.com/2011/05/what-i-wear-everyday.html) (I must admit, her post is much more amusing then mine), which showed images of her wardrobe consisting only of T-shirts and jeans in various colors.

If you are an avid blogger, or at least an avid reader of blogs, I’m sure you have run across the vast array of “style” posts. These are the posts that make you feel incredibly guilty for not looking like a size 0 model in $700 jeans every day of the week. The featured outfits usually include a few of the following: high-heeled boots, peasant blouse, vintage blazer, bedazzling jewelry, skinny jeans, large belts, leather hand bag, lots of makeup, and so on.

As much as I may like these featured outfits, I am the Queen of Practicality. It’s true. Just ask my mother who sends me birthday money with a note saying, “do not use for bills.” So, what does this practical girl buy every single time she reluctantly changes out of her sweatpants to run to the mall?

T-shirts and Jeans.

Now, I’m sure you are thinking, “that’s not a big deal, I wear lots of T-shirts and jeans.” My reply, “you ain’t seen nothin’ yet.”

The pictures I’ve included are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">just a few</span> of the T-shirts and jeans that I currently own. The picture above features 10 pairs of jeans (2 are skirts), and 10 t-shirts/tanks. I have 6 more jean varieties in the closet and many more T’s, not to mention all my Milligan t-shirt attire (2 drawers full).

Although the amount of jeans and t-shirts does seem to go against my previous statement of being practical, I do actually wear them all, all the time. That is more than I can say for the few dressier items I own. And, since I’ve pretty much been the same size since 8th grade, my jean collection is 9 years in the making. So, it’s maybe only half as bad as it seems.

Do I ever dress up? Of course, I actually enjoy dressing up from time to time and I DO own a few dressier items, but jeans and t-shirts are the majority by far.

_A Pros list for practical me:_

1.  All of my jeans can be paired with all of my t-shirts. Talk about versatility and easy dressing.
2.  Dress them up with heels, a jacket, and jewelry.
3.  Dress down with flip-flops and a cute headband.
4.  For cooler days, pair your t-shirt with a sweater and throw a pair of rain boots on over your jeans.
5.  For warmer days, pull out the jean capris or skirt and a pair of flip-flops to keep you cool.

See, now the next time you are staring dazed and confused into the wreckage you once knew as a closet, just throw on your favorite pair of jeans and a t-shirt, thus allowing for more time to enjoy a cup of coffee, or actually eat breakfast.

Just a few lemon chocolate truffles to share with you for Valentine’s day.

You can find the recipe at [Swapna’s Cuisine](http://www.swapnascuisine.com/2011/10/lemon-truffles.html). First, I made her version using white chocolate…

Then I made them with milk chocolate. This version has a flavor combination similar to the orange -chocolate eggs, surprisingly delicious.

The envelope was for Jack’s card. I simply wrapped red string around it until I approved of the pattern.

Hope you all are able to spend some time with those you love and who love you. Happy Valentine’s Day!

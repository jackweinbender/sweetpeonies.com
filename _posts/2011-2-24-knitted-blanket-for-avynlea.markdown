I’ve been working on this blanket for my soon-to-be niece, Avynlea. Her mommy asked for pink to match the room. I ended up with 2 shades of pink that are girly but not necessarily little girl, girly. I like to think these colors are a bit sophisticated as well.

I chose Loops & Threads brand Country Loom thread. I love this thread because it is a little fluffy so it hides mistakes well. My colors are (from right to left below), Rodeo, Warm Cream, and Snapdragon. Snapdragon is my favorite!

I like to knit while doing other things (watching Biggest Loser)so I decided not to count rows because I know I’ll get distracted. Instead I am knitting one whole ball of yarn (104 yards/95m) for each pink color (ends up being 16 whole rows-32 single rows) and separating them with 8 whole (whole=”down and back”) rows of cream. Another great striped blanket pattern can be found [here](http://www.purlbee.com/the-purl-bee/2010/10/17/purl-soho-kit-the-super-easy-baby-blanket.html).

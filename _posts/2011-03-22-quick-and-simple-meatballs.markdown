Have you ever had a late night craving you just can’t shake? Well, I have for the past two weeks! I am not sure why, but suddenly a meatball sandwich sounded glorious. I don’t think I have ever eaten a meatball sandwich but I wanted one none-the-less.

When I realized this craving was not going away, I broke down and went to the store for some ground Italian sausage and made these quick and easy meatballs for my sandwich.

**Ingredients:**

1 package ground Italian Sausage  
1/4 c onions  
1/2 c bread crumbs  
1/4 c shaved parmesan  
1 egg  
1 tsp garlic powder  
1 tsp oregano  
1 tsp Italian seasoning  
1 tsp pepper  
1/2 tsp salt

**Directions:**

Set oven to 350 degrees. Chop the onion into small pieces. Mix all ingredients.

Roll mixture into 1in. meatballs and place on a cooking sheet. Cook for 20 minutes.

Once the meatballs are done cooking, combine meatballs and a sauce of your choice in a large saucepan. I of course went with what we had in the cupboard which was a simple traditional spaghetti sauce (yes, from a can… *gasp*).

Only add enough sauce to be able to coat your meatballs after you’ve rolled them around for a bit. I used half of a 16 oz jar. I also added 2 tsp. of Worcestershire, 2 tsp. garlic, 1 tsp. oregano, and a dash of pepper and salt.

Let your meatballs simmer in the sauce for about 10-15 minutes.

If you are looking to make a meatball sandwich as well, slice some onions and mushrooms and saute over medium heat while the meatballs are simmering. Once the meatballs are finished remove your sauteed veggies and create your sub.

Oh so yummy with very little work. Good luck and happy cooking!

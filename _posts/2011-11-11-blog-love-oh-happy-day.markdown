_[Oh Happy Day!](http://ohhappyday.com/)_ Simply reading the name of this blog lifts my spirits. Since it is Friday, I thought what better way to celebrate such a happy occasion than by introducing you to a cheerful, creative, and inspiring blogger.

She is smart, talented, and super creative. She and her family recently moved from San Francisco to Paris for one year. Her posts are filled with breathtaking photos of Parisian scenery, shops, and fashion. She is a party planner and letterpress printer with tons of creative DIY projects and home decor ideas that are sure to inspire.

Here are a few of my favorite _Oh Happy Day!_ projects:

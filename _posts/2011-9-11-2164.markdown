This was the day. The day that I said, it can wait no more. This was the day I thought, “I _must_ write an absolutely outstanding blog post for my readers today.”

It is now 8 p.m. and after 6 hours of mixing, rolling, stamping (yep, cookie stamps), and packaging 250 cookies for the Milligan College advancement office, I have decided that this is **not** the day.

Jack decided to document me after 6 straight hours of standing, mixing, etc. This is what I look like right now…

Here is me with 120 of my lovely cookies.

Here is me baking the last batch of cookies and imitating someone. I’m not really as mad as I look, I just get a little cranky when I’ve been standing this long.

Me, wondering how much longer Jack is going to snap photos.

And, of course, the cookies. The “M” is for MILLIGAN!

I have mentioned this recipe multiple times, but just in case you haven’t tried it yet here are my [super yummy & simple shortbread cookies](http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2011/02/rummy-shortbread-cookies/).

I am off to cram in a few hours of studying for my MedSurg test. Sorry I couldn’t roll out the blogging magic today folks. I promise I’ll make it up to you.

Thanks for stopping by!

**Instructions:**

Follow the directions for your rice of choice. Add 2 tbsp soy sauce and 1 tsp ginger to the rice before covering. Set the rice aside to cook and get started on the shrimp and veggies.

Warm the olive oil in a skillet on medium heat. Add shrimp, honey, pepper, sage, and garlic. Wait until shrimp is lightly browned and add mushrooms and onion. Cook until veggies are tender.

The rice should be done by now. So, now for the best part, dress your plate and enjoy!

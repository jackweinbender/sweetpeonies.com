Jack and I are always looking for low-calorie, high protein and of course, good tasting snacks to hold us over throughout the busy day. We have been trying out various trail mix varieties over the last few weeks and finally figured out an inexpensive way to make our very own.

[![homemade granola](jekyll_uploads/2012/03/homemadegranola-325x488.jpg "homemadegranola")](http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/03/granola-trail-mix/homemadegranola/)Instead of using a nut-based mix, we decided to use granola as the main ingredient and add in mixed nuts, M&Ms, and craisins. We bought a bulk bag of craisins for $3 and a bulk nuts for $4\.

As for the granola, all it takes is a few cups of old-fashioned oats.

_Granola:_

3 c. old-fashioned oats  
3 tbsp. brown sugar  
1/4 tsp. salt  
1/2 tsp. cinnamon  
1/3 c. honey  
1/4 c. canola oil  
1 tsp. vanilla

_Directions:_</nbsp></nbsp>

Preheat oven to 300 degrees Fahrenheit. Combine oats, sugar, salt and cinnamon in a large bowl. Combine remaining ingredients in a separate bowl. Pour honey mixture over oats-coat thoroughly. Once the oats are coated, spread onto a cookie sheet, thin and even. Place in oven. Stir the granola at least every 12 minutes to keep it from burning–you really don’t want this to burn. Remove granola from oven after 30 minutes or when oats turn a golden brown. Allow to cool completely. Add mixed nuts, fruit, chocolate, craisins or whatever else you can think of to spice up your trail mix. Here’s where I learned all about [granola making](http://www.chow.com/food-news/55265/how-to-make-granola/).

Adding fruit to your mix can become quite expensive, however you can easily dry your own fruit pieces. Jack is currently drying mangoes to add to our mix–yummy!

I used 1/4 of the bag of craisins and 1/4 the box of nuts with 1 batch of oats to yield about 8 cups of trail mix. Why is this important to note? We can make a few more batches!

You can also skip the trail mix and simply eat the granola for breakfast.

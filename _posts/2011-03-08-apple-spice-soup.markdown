My friend Kelly is getting married in a few months and asked me to sew her table runners for the reception. She brought over a sampling of fabric to work with on Tuesday and since I donâ€™t need much of an excuse to make a big pot of soup, I went ahead and experimented with a new combination of veggies for the evening.

This soup was a bit spicy for me but Jack loved it so I recommend deciding what level of spice you can handle before you cut up your jalapeno. If you like just a little kick at the end I would only use 1/4 of a large jalapeno.

**Ingredients:**

2 apples  
1 large sweet potato  
1/2 onion  
1/2 large jalapeno  
1/4 c. white wine  
1 32oz. box chicken broth  
1 tbsp butter  
1 tsp. garlic  
1 tsp. cinnamon  
1/2 tsp. salt  
1/2 tsp/ pepper

**Directions:**

Chop the apples, sweet potato, onion, and jalapeno into thinly sliced chunks. Add ingredients to large soup pan along with 1 tbsp. of butter. Add spices. Mix well. Add 1/4 c. white wine of your choice, mine was a chardonnay. Stir until ingredients are coated. Add half the broth, cover, and bring to a boil. Stir, add the rest of the broth and let simmer for at least 30 minutes.

You only have to let it simmer until the veggies are soft but the flavors are better if you let it simmer longer, plus cooking it longer makes your house smell fabulous!

Finally, pour ingredients into a mixer and puree. Presto your soup is complete! If you want a creamier soup, simply add a small amount of cream to the mix after you puree.

I also made this [herb quick bread](http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Herb-Quick-Bread/Detail.aspx) from allrecipes.com to go with the soup. It was quick (which is what I needed) but had an interesting texture. I added rosemary, garlic, and thyme in mine and it paired well with the soup.

Good luck and happy cooking!

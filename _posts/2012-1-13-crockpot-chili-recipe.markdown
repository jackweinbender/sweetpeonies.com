[![](jekyll_uploads/2012/01/2011-Snow-2-325x199.jpg "Snow")](http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/01/crockpot-chili-recipe/2011-snow-2/)Woke up this morning, my third day back in class, to a wonderful text message alerting me of our snow delay! Looking outside it was hard to not mock our little corner of Tennessee for their never-fail overreactions to winter weather (less than 1 in. this morning). However, I got to go back to sleep for 45 minutes before my long day, so no complaining here. I’ve been hanging onto this chili recipe, waiting for that perfectly brisk and chilling day to share it with you. I think you’ll agree after seeing this picture that today’s the day!

This savory chili is sure to warm both your heart and tummy on days like these when you just can’t seem to escape the winter chill. Simply throw the ingredients together at night or in the morning, and leave the crock pot on low throughout the day–allowing your humble abode to fill with the welcoming aromas of coffee, chocolate, and spices.

**_Crockpot Chili_**

3 cups pinto beans (or 2-3 cans if not using dry)  
2 cans kidney beans  
1 lb ground beef  
8 oz can of tomato sauce  
1 tsp cocoa  
1/2 tsp cinnamon  
2 tsp garlic powder  
1 tsp parsley  
1 tbsp Worcestershire  
Easy BBQ Sauce (see recipe below)  
1 sweet onion (chopped)  
5 carrots (shredded and chopped)  
2 Roma tomatoes (chopped)

**_Easy BBQ Sauce  
_**

1 cup ketchup  
1/2 cup red wine vinegar  
1/2 cup brown sugar  
2 tablespoons soy sauce  
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce  
2 tablespoons spicy brown mustard  
1 teaspoon ground ginger  
1 teaspoon garlic powder  
1 tablespoon olive oil

_Directions:_  
If you are using dry pinto beans, soak overnight and prepare beans per instructions on the bag.

Place 1 lb of thawed ground beef in your slow cooker. Season with cinnamon, garlic, parsley and anything else that floats your boat. I threw in a pack of Goya seasoning. It is fantastic and can be found in the Hispanic food section of the grocery store, it is in an orange and white box.

Separate the meat a bit and allow to brown slightly. Add beans, tomato sauce, Worcestershire, and cocoa. Prepare the Easy BBQ Sauce by simply combining the ingredients above on the stove then pour into the crock pot. I changed a few ingredients to work with what we had in the fridge, but the [here](http://www.recipetips.com/recipe-cards/t--2516/easy-barbecue-sauce.asp) is the original.

Shred the carrots first, then chop. Chop the onion and tomatoes. Add vegetables to crock pot. Stir well and let sit until you are ready to eat. If you are preparing this a couple hours before eating, set the crock pot on high, if you are planning to leave it on all day, set the crock pot on low. Remember, as with most crock pot dishes, the longer it cooks the tastier it becomes. This is also the recipe I used to prepare our semester of [freezer meals](http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/01/how-to-prepare-freezer-meals/).

Hope this warms you up on the cold days to come. Welcome to Winter!

I made these tasty pecan tarts this weekend, recipe courtesy of momma Mary, for the Chamber Youth Leadership graduation reception at Milligan. These mini tarts are quick and easy to make, not to mention they taste phenomenal. Great for any shower or large get-together.

**Ingredients:**

**Shell:**  
1/2 c. butter  
3 oz. cream cheese  
1 c. flour  
Pecan Filling:  
2 tbsp. butter  
3/4 c. brown sugar  
2 tsp. vanilla  
1 egg  
1 c. chopped pecans

**Instructions:**

Starting with the shell, blend butter and cream cheese. Once blended, add flour and mix. Dough will be crumbly.

Mix dough into 1.5 inch balls and place each in muffin slots on a mini muffin pan.

Use a mini-tart shaper to press down in the middle of the dough, pushing the dough up along the sides of the pan.

If you do not have a tart shaper, like me, use the end of another tool from your vast array of cooking utensils. I used the blunt end of a pizza cutter.

I also flattened out the edges of my dough, pressing them into the side of the pan so there would be more room for filling.

Now to the fillingâ€¦

Mix all filling ingredients except the pecans with a blender.

Once ingredients are combined, pour in 1 c. of chopped pecans and mix with a spoon.

Now, fill your tart shells with the filling. Fill only to the top edge of the shell.

Bake at 350 degrees for 20 minutes and voila! Mini pecan pies.

_A few tips:_

1.  You do not need to grease or spray your muffin pan prior to filling with dough. The butter in the dough keeps it from sticking.
2.  If you have trouble getting the pies out of the pan, use a thin piece of cardboard or a thick piece of paper to slide along the edges and it will pop right out.
3.  Dust the end of your dough-pressing tool with flour to keep it from sticking.
4.  Although small, these are fairly rich so you really do not need to make them any bigger than mini-muffin size.

Happy baking!

I hope you all enjoyed your holiday weekend. Ours was absolutely wonderful–gorgeous weather, great friends, and good food–what more can a girl ask for?

This week we will be staying with a friend as we make the trek up to see my parents. I decided our brief overnight stay required a little thank-you treat. I decided to bake mini lemon cupcakes (you know in those tiny cupcake liners–so cute!). Anyways, I needed a good way to dress up the gift bag. Here’s what I came up with on the fly.

I started with this little blue bag to hold my mini treats. Prior to filling the bag, I used a glue stick to attach a mini doily to the front. Then I filled the bag with treats and tied an aqua bow around the bag to finish off the gift bag decor.

That’s it, a quick and simple way to spruce up small gift decor.

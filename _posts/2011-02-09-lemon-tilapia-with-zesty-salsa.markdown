**Ingredients:**

1 cup rice  
2 Tilapia fillets  
1/2 bunch of cilantro (chopped)  
2 roma tomatoes (diced)  
3 stalks of green onion (chopped)  
1/4 c. red onion (chopped)  
1/2 small zucchini (chopped)  
2tbsp olive oil  
1tbsp lemon juice  
1 tbsp lime juice  
pepper/salt/garlic powder

**Preparation:**

The rice takes the longest amount of time to prepare so go ahead and boil your water and get the rice going before you start in on the following steps.

Chop all the vegetables. Heat 1 tbsp of olive oil in a frying pan on low. Add in the vegetables and let them warm up slowly in the pan (do not add in the cilantro now). Add in just a dash of pepper and garlic (or more if you’re like us and can’t get enough garlic).Sprinkle in a bit of lime juice (1-2 tsp). Stir occasionally and leave the vegetables to warm up while you prepare the fish.

Heat 1-2 tbsp olive oil in skillet. If you have a large enough skillet feel free to cook both fillets at the same time. We eat so much fish that we buy the prepackaged fillets in the seafood section of the store. These kind are thin enough where they only take about 3 minutes to cook so it doesn’t take long if you choose to cook them separately. Once the olive oil is hot drop in the tilapia and cook about 1.5 minutes on each side (may be longer depending on how thick your fillet is). Sprinkle each side of your fish with pepper and just a touch of salt and well as a spray or two of lemon juice.

Go ahead and add the cilantro to the vegetables and mix it up. With any luck your rice will be finished by this point. This is when I dress the plate. I use about a 1/2 c. of the rice as my base, then I lay the tilapia on top of the rice bed and go back over to the pan of veggies (make sure the cilantro is warm but not soggy looking) to dish the salsa on top of the fish.

A few pictures from dad’s annual golf trip with his brother and brother-in-law.

Instead of Idaho, this year’s trip was spent in North Carolina, which meant the hubby and I were able to join the golfing fun over Easter weekend.

Jake joined the boys in two 18-hole rounds of golf each day while I attempted to soak up as much sun as possible while driving around the cart.

Beautiful weather, beautiful golf courses.

All in all, a fantastic Easter and such a blessing to see my dad.

It’s the little seemingly insignificant details that make a house a home. In these posts, I will be highlighting some on the little details in our home that make it stand out as unique, creative, and simply put, ours.

I would love to also feature images from you readers, showcasing some of the little details in your house that make it feel like home. Please send me an [email](tiffany@thekitchencurtains.net) with your photo submissions and I will highlight a different reader’s photo every other week.

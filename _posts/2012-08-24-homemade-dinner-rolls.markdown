To continue my attempt at stocking our freezer ([Lower Grocery Bills & Freezer Meals](http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/09/lower-your-grocery-bill-monthly-meals-part-2/)), I decided to bake homemade rolls to accompany our soups. I usually direct all bread-making ventures to Jack because, unlike me, he is patient. When I bake I want to prepare the food, put it in the oven, wash the dishes, and pull the food out of the oven. Simple, easy, no hassle, and no waiting between steps. All that to say, these are the characteristics I look for in a bread recipe–I know, it’s sad, but this time it worked!

This recipe is incredibly easy and really doesn’t take long. I followed it to a tee, but changed the seasonings on top.

“My Favorite Buttermilk Dinner Rolls” from The Bread Bible (slightly altered):

_Ingredients:_

1 tbsp dry yeast  
Pinch of Sugar  
1/4 c. warm water  
1 c. warm buttermilk  
2 tbsp. honey  
4 tbsp. butter  
1 large egg  
2 tsp. salt  
4 c. all-purpose flour (plus some for dusting during kneading)

_Directions:_

1.) In a small bowl combine yeast, sugar and water. Dissolve and let stand until foamy, roughly 10 minutes.

2.) In a large bowl, combine buttermilk, sugar, butter (melted), egg, and salt. Mix in 1-1/2 c. flour and yeast mixture. Beat on high for 2 minutes.

3.) Continue to add the remainder of the flour 1/2 c. at a time with a wooden spoon.

4.) Turn dough onto lightly floured surface and knead until smooth, 4-7 minutes by hand. Use flour to prevent sticking, 1 tbsp at a time.

5.) Grease a large bowl and place smooth dough inside. Turn dough over so top is greased. Cover the bowl with saran wrap and let rise until doubled in size, 1-1/2 hours.

6.) Deflate dough and turn out onto floured surface. Divide dough in half and roll each into a 2 to 3 inch cylinder. Cut each into 8 equal portions. Roll each into a small oval.

7.) Lay dough balls on a greased baking sheet about 3 inches apart. Cover with saran wrap and let sit for 30 minutes.

8.) Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Brush each roll with egg glaze (1 egg, 1 tbsp water, 1 tbsp milk). Sprinkle the top of the rolls with garlic, thyme, sesame seeds and pepper (or choose your own combination).

9.) Cut small diagonal slashes on top of each roll. Place in the oven for 15 minutes or until golden brown. If using 2 baking sheets, switch top to bottom halfway through baking process.

10.) Allow to cool before serving and enjoy!

These rolls freeze beautifully. Just make sure you seal them up nice and tight and try to get all the air out of the bag or container you store them in to reduce the chance of moisture getting trapped inside.

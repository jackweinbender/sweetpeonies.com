Hello Friends! I have two months of freezer meals, schedules and recipes to share with you today. You can link directly to [Freezer Meal Schedule & Planning: Month #3](http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/10/freezer-meal-schedule-and-planning/) here.

Our second month of once-a-month-shopping and freezer meals was a little haphazard due to my lack of diligent planning on the front-end with meals, however, we made it through the month with only one extra trip to the store for a special dinner we hosted for a couple of friends. At the end of [Freezer Meals: Month #1](http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/09/lower-your-grocery-bill-monthly-meals-part-2/ "Lower Your Grocery Bill & Monthly Meals (Part 2)") we still had about six burger meals leftover, four carrot soups, and five servings of chili. Those meals were then incorporated into the next month’s meal schedule.

Here is a link to my groceries for [month #2](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ApU9WwQlN06CdEZKaVpkeGk4UGVhamJCRTBKOFZEdEE). I only included the food groceries for a general guideline and left off the detergents, lunch baggies, etc. There weren’t as many BOGO deals at Ingles this month but I took advantage of some of their discounts on chicken broth, kitchen bags and tomato sauces for the following month. Our total grocery store trip (between two stores) cost $102.47\. Throughout the month, we also spent $12 more at the produce stand down the street.

Check out our [first month of freezer meals](http://www.sweetpeonies.com/2012/09/lower-your-grocery-bill-monthly-meals-part-2/) for recipes that were re-made or leftover (carrot soup, roasted red potatoes, homemade dinner rolls, Chili)

**Grilled Corn and Potato Chowder:**

Since the weather was starting to cool down a bit, we decided to make another soup, and this time a bit heartier one. We chose this [grilled corn and potato chowder](http://www.myrecipes.com/recipe/grilled-corn-potato-chowder-10000001918508/) from MyRecipes–it is awesome! I was a bit skeptical, especially as I was making a corn paste with our food processor, but it is really a treat. We ended up adding in more of the corn paste, because it added such a good flavor, and a bit more milk (1%). I did not use fresh thyme, just the ol’ dried stuff, and instead of actual corn ears, I used canned (cause it’s what I had) and grilled it with salt and red pepper before throwing into the food processor.

**Taquitos:**

We also bought a package of those mini flour tortillas, great for making taquitos. I pulled out my last bag of plain shredded beef from a roast we made last year and placed rice, beans onion, and the shredded beef into the tortillas, rolled them and lined them up in a casserole dish to freeze. Every time we wanted taquitos, we simply pulled out the dish, broke off four taquitos and baked them in the oven for about 35 minutes. We typically ate these with a side of rice and a salad. I used about 3 cups of shredded beef and 3 cups of rice and 2 cup of beans to make 24 taquitos (we adjusted this for the next month if you don’t want to use the meat).

Our last addition to month #2 of freezer meals was an experiment by me for sloppy joe chicken. I love normal sloppy joes, minus the grease and I wanted to at least pretend I was making a slightly healthier version by using chicken (we really like our chicken). I basically just started throwing things together to see what I could come up with and this sweet & sloppy sauce hits the spot every time. Seriously, it’s our favorite meal now, and yes, we continued it into the next month.

<a id="sweet-sloppy"></a>**Sweet & Sloppy Joe Chicken:**

4 large chicken breasts  
2 cups ketchup  
2 tbsp Worchsetershire  
2 tbsp balsamic vinegar  
1 tbsp red wine vinegar  
3 tbsp brown sugar  
1 tsp ground mustard  
1 tsp pepper  
2 tsp garlic powder  
salt

Since it was our first attempt at this sauce we started off with a small batch and only used four large chicken breasts (the next month we tried it with one rotisserie chicken from the store ($4 and same amount of meals). Put the chicken in the crockpot, let it cook through, add the rest of the ingredients, allow to cook on low in the crockpot for one hour. Voila, sweet and sloppy chicken. We toasted wheat hamburger buns and piled on the sloppy joe chicken.

Hope you are able to find some helpful recipe ideas in this post. Be sure to check out the rest of the posts in this series:

With one month left of school I feel like I am crawling out of my skin with craft fever. I have been attempting to finish Avynlea’s knitted blanket for the past 2 months and this week I have finally made it about 1/3 of the way. I am now halfway through color number 3 which means I get to start over and finally have a pattern! Although the process is slow it feels so good to see progress.

So, here are some pictures of said progress. Maybe it will inspire those of you who also have half-finished projects lying around. You CAN do it! Perhaps slowly, like me, but slow and steady wins the race… at least that’s what I hear.

Here is a link to the [original knitted blanket](http://thekitchencurtain.blogspot.com/2011/02/knitted-blanket-for-avynlea.html) post complete with instructions.

Best of luck as you finish those pesky projects that never seem to end. I’ll be sure to keep you apprised on Avy’s blankie.

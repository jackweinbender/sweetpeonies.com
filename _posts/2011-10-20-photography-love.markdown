This post is extremely random but I just had to share it with you all. Kira, of [Kira Noble Photography](http://www.kiranoblephotography.com/), is one fantastic photographer. I get extremely giddy every time I see that she has posted new photos because I just can’t wait to see what else she has come up with.

Yesterday she posted this quote which I love! (photo: the kitchen curtains)

“Fairy tales are more than true; not because they tell us that dragons exist, but because they tell us that dragons can be beaten.”  
― G.K. Chesterton

And on Monday she posted these [self-portraits](http://www.kiranoblephotographyblog.com/?p=1339) on her blog with lots and lots of glitter. She is beautiful all the time as you can see here, and these pictures are exquisite.

Head on over to her [blog](http://www.kiranoblephotographyblog.com/) to check out more of her photos.

“As I look backward over a long checkered life, it seems to me that the hand of God has been weaving a beautiful pattern of many colors and shapes for me and for the people who have been and who will be associated with me.” -Leona Auer

Leona Auer is 101 years old and a Milligan alumna. This past week, I had the privilege of interviewing her and was simply in awe of who she is, where she has been and what she has seen. The quote above is from one of her books, “A Whistling Girl and A Crowing Hen.”

On a completely unrelated note: we are finishing out the last three weeks of classes so please excuse the sporadic posting–12 tests to go and then I’m all yours.

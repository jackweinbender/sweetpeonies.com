Thursday on the farm was the annual “Teapots & Tablecloths” workshop with 15 lovely ladies who were bold enough to brave the humidity. Unfortunately, I left my memory card in Linda’s computer, so the new farm photos will have to wait until after the weekend to be posted.

I did manage to procure this butterfly photo from my day of cutting on Friday. This lovely butterfly and about 100 of his friends made cutting in the heat a bit more enjoyable. Maybe it was the heat, but I found myself apologizing profusely to the butterflies for stealing their flowers. I also found myself wishing that all bugs were butterflies.

Although Linda may disagree with me, I feel like I have come a long way these past 2 years in my interactions with, reaction to, and knowledge of farm critters. I no longer scream like a 6-year-old girl when an unexpected banana spider makes its presence known. I also finally realized that…  
a.) buzzing does not necessarily equal bee  
b.) stinging is not a bee’s sole purpose.

I have learned that the rustling noises in the field are, in fact, not the aliens from Signs. Although I’ve still never actually seen the devious rodent(s), so I suppose it’s still a possibility. Moving on…cows are good listeners and being able to distinguish between a snake and a black hose can be a tricky task (Hint: It’s a hose).

I’ve learned that hornworms (see below) devour an entire tomato plant in 4 short hours. Although I found him on my porch and not on the farm, I thought this creepy crawler deserved a shout out as one of the many bugs I wish was a butterfly. Apparently there are two varieties, one for tomato plants and one for tobacco plants. They have a black “horn” out the back, grow to be about 4 inches, and appear suddenly to devour your plant in one day. Not my favorite garden guest.

Last notes on farm critters…Tennessee mosquitoes are much more aggressive than Oregon mosquitoes. Dead wood should be kicked before picked up or you may quickly find your arm covered by ants. In the spring, don’t look up into the trees while under them or you’ll likely catch a gypsy moth larvae with your face.

And of course, butterflies are the best bugs!

I hope you’ve enjoyed my farm critter post and pictures. Be sure to check back soon for pictures from Thursday’s “Teapots & Tablecloths.”

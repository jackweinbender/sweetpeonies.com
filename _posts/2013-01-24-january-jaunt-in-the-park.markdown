I know I’ve probably bored you to death with photos of our favorite state park, Sycamore Shoals, but I wanted to prove to you just how much we love this spot. We even brave weather in the teens with biting cold wind whipping off the river just for a joyful jaunt along the beautiful trails. It is amazing to me how beautiful this place is even in the dead of winter. Hope you all are bundled up tight and staying toasty warm this evening.
